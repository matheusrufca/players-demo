1
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,120
Hey, hey, hey!

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,440
What the fuck?

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,040
Wait! I gotta call it in!

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,040
Move it!

5
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,087
Hey!

6
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,091
Bobby, you hear me?

7
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,330
Right there, motherfucker!

8
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,851
Please.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,843
Just fucking stop, man!

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,525
Just put the gun down!

11
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,808
Come on.

12
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,007
Please.

13
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,610
I'm fucking begging you.

14
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,366
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,601
I wasn't even...

16
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,771
Worse on Friday
Died on Saturday

17
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,046
Buried on Sunday

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,971
That was the end

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,962
Justine, please.

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,244
It's called "stimming," self-stimulation.

23
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,924
Whereas you and I might tap our fingers,

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
grind our teeth, bite our nails,

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,489
your son rocks back and forth.

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,445
It's more obvious, but perfectly natural.

27
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,087
We came here because
we heard you specialized in...

28
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,129
What is it? What does he have?

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,931
I'm not a fan of labels, ma'am.

30
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,285
Your son is a remarkable young man.

31
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,205
Who goes crazy
when you turn the vacuum on.

32
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,443
He wears one T-shirt,
won't let you hug him.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,443
Loud noises, bright lights

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,922
can be especially difficult
for someone like your son.

35
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,329
The shirt, most likely fabric sensitivity.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,609
Hugging, closeness, touching...

37
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,881
Justine, no shoes today.

38
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,530
That can be a challenge, yes.

39
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,210
When it's somebody else's child,
it's a challenge.

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,806
When it's yours, it's a problem.

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,690
My practice focuses on education.

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,320
I'd like to work with your son,
at his speed.

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,208
Help him develop the skills
he'll need to lead a full life.

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,243
Communicating, eye contact,
understanding non-verbal cues,

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,845
making friends.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,810
The only friend he has
is his little brother.

47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,324
I'm sure moving from base to base
hasn't helped.

48
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,005
My husband's in the Army,
which means we all are.

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,164
Would you be willing to let your son
stay with us for the summer

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,927
free of charge, working with me
in a sensory-friendly environment?

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,730
That's not gonna happen.

52
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,000
If loud noises and bright lights
bother him,

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,561
he needs more of it, not less.

54
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,369
The world is not a sensory-friendly place,

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,688
and that's where
he needs to learn to live.

56
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,760
Not in here.

57
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,404
Doctor, in your opinion,
can our son lead a normal life?

58
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,248
Define normal.

59
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,523
I need to finish! I need to finish!

Buried on Sunday

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,731
Hmm. Mmm.

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,084
I, uh... I never thought of myself as
a quitter... Fourth-generation farmer.

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,641
But between the property taxes

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,766
and the fertilizer costs, and insurance...

74
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,086
Oh, to hell with it.

75
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,647
What if, just temporarily, mind you,

76
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,644
we put this year's taxes
on our credit card?

77
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,371
Do you like it?

78
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,885
I made it myself.

79
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,610
No, not particularly.

80
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,970
But do you ever sell them?

81
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,610
At church fairs now and again.

82
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,724
Mrs. Rice, you may have what the IRS
calls a "home-based business."

83
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,008
What room do you use in your house
when you make those?

84
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,207
I don't, really.

85
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,010
Just wherever I happen to be, I guess.

86
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,640
In front of the TV, at the kitchen table.

87
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,041
I like to spread my beads out
in the dining room, but Frank gets...

88
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,487
Yes, it would be better
if you could try to remember

89
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,961
the one specific space that you use.

90
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,328
Your home is 2,913 square feet.

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,490
IRS code allows us to deduct
from your taxable income

92
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,325
a percentage of your workspace
relative to your overall home.

93
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,561
- What...
- Mr. Rice...

94
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,530
How big is your dining room?

95
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,400
Mrs. Rice's office.

96
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,768
I wouldn't so much as call it an office...

97
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,121
Oh.

98
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,407
It's, uh, approximately 200, uh...

99
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,008
Well, make it 300 square feet.

100
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,685
Excellent. Mrs. Rice...

101
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,921
Dolores.

102
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,448
Dolores, when you order supplies,
do you order online?

103
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,001
I don't. I just zip on over
to the bead store.

104
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,400
Zip?

105
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,160
I drive the truck.

106
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,570
The company truck.

107
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,361
Come in.

108
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,284
Mr. King, you have wandered
so far outside your legal purview.

109
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,010
As president of Southern Gulf Bank,

110
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,731
I intend to protect
my customers' privacy...

111
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,927
Stop talking.

112
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,401
You have a very cavalier attitude
for the president of a bank,

113
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,925
with such a piss-poor capital cushion.

114
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,727
Now, I want a record of every transaction
Abayed has had for the past two years.

115
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,565
Deposits, withdrawals,
cashier's checks, credit cards.

116
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,883
Birmingham or Bahrain,
it is now Treasury business.

117
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,405
Goodbye.

118
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,085
Medina.

119
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,605
Am I saying that correctly?

120
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,886
Medina, yes, sir.

121
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,250
I've read all your case files,
Director King.

122
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,085
It's impressive work. Very.

123
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,403
Marybeth Ascension Medina.

124
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,927
Graduated University of Baltimore
cum laude

125
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,128
with a degree in criminal justice.

126
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,842
Two years Baltimore PD as an analyst,
two more at Homeland, analyst again,

127
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,801
and the last five years here at Treasury.

128
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,166
Analyst.

129
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,687
You did the heavy lifting
on Agent Lorenz's case last month.

130
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,442
I worked on it, yeah, but Agent Lorenz...

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,285
Why haven't you applied
for promotion to agent?

132
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,285
You're already doing the work.

133
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,930
Analyst is a good fit.

134
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,124
And I enjoy the work, so...

135
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,684
Well, you're a liar, Medina.

136
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,405
Ward of the state of Maryland's

137
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,847
foster care and juvenile detention systems

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,128
from age 11 to 18.

139
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,284
Weapons charges, assault and battery.

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,201
Ouch.

141
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,203
Attempted murder.

142
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,569
Those records were sealed.

143
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,564
Is that a nine millimeter?

144
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,641
.45.

145
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,168
You better sit your ass
back down in that chair, young lady.

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,162
This is a big moment for you.

147
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,249
Make a good choice.

148
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,326
Lying on a federal employment application
is a felony.

149
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,009
So right now, I'm the only thing standing
between you and significant prison time.

150
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,169
What do you want?

151
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,003
Do you like puzzles, Marybeth Medina?

152
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,523
I meant what I said, son.
You're welcome out to the place anytime.

153
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,330
Do you fish? I got a two-acre pond

154
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,845
that is just thick with catfish and bass...

155
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,361
I don't fish. I shoot.

156
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,206
Well, the farm's a perfect place
to do a little plinkin', so...

157
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,041
Well...

158
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,081
Thank you.

159
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,724
You take care, son.

160
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,961
Thank you.

161
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,483
My daughter's meeting me for lunch.
I think you two just might hit it off.

162
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,051
Nice to see you.

163
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,801
Already enhanced.

164
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,248
Was taken three years ago in Antwerp
by an undercover Interpol agent.

165
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,289
Their target's on the far right.

166
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,886
Yeah, Zalmay Atta.

167
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,647
Go on.

168
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,726
Ran the world's largest opium pipeline.

169
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,406
Ties to Karzai and Ghani, Taliban.

170
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,006
I mean, he was considered untouchable.

171
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,402
Look at the rest. Tell me what you see.

172
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,924
Yeah, I remember most of these arrests.
They were huge.

173
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,242
Focus. They're not all arrests.

174
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,770
It's the same man.

175
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,365
"Lou Carroll."

176
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,923
For what it's worth, it's an alias.

177
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,202
The Hong Kong photo
goes back about five years.

178
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,966
In that one, he's "Carl Gauss."

179
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,449
Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Naples.
There was a sighting in Tehran.

180
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,523
All describing the same man.
"An accountant."

181
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,121
"Our accountant." "The accountant."

182
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,409
The accountant, like CPA accountant?

183
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,486
Okay.

184
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,646
Say you're the head of the Sinaloa Cartel.

185
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,367
Now, the cartels count their money

186
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,682
by weighing it in 18-wheelers.

187
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,129
But one sunny Mexican day,

188
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,961
your in-house money scrubber comes to you
and says you're 30 million light.

189
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,401
Who can you trust to do
the forensic accounting,

190
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,324
track your stolen cash?

191
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,687
Deloitte and Touche? H&R Block?

192
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,643
You somehow

193
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,690
contact an individual
capable of coming in cold,

194
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,167
un-cooking years of books,

195
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,842
and getting out alive.

196
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,810
I retire in seven months.

197
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,682
Before I do, I need to know
who he is, how he does it.

198
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,411
I mean, who survives
this kind of clientele?

199
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,602
The secrets this guy has.

200
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,411
What exactly do you want me to do?

201
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,169
Report directly to me.

202
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,850
No other case work.

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,367
No other Treasury personnel involved.

204
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,129
At the end of the month,
one of two things will have occurred.

205
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,042
Resolution of this case,

206
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,407
or we update your photo.

207
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,801
You want it your way? You got it!

208
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,970
Mom! Mom! Mom!

209
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,327
Mom! Why is Mom leaving? Mom!

210
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,289
Mom! Mom!

211
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,643
- I just got home.
- You're always...

212
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,721
Mom! Why are you leaving?

213
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,007
I'm just asking you to stay.

214
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,321
- Just, please stay.
- We had help!

215
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,369
- Stay here! Don't go anywhere!
- You threw it away!

216
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,566
No. Hey.

217
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,361
That's it.

218
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,601
Please don't leave...

219
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,445
Mom!

220
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,921
Here we go, here we go.

221
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,681
Here we go.

222
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,049
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

223
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,046
Christened on Tuesday
Married on a Wednesday

224
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,362
Sick on Thursday

225
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,404
Died on a Saturday
Buried on Sunday

226
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,962
- That was the end of Solomon Grundy
- That was the end of Solomon Grundy

227
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,804
Do it again.

228
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,884
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

229
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,251
Looks like somebody's seen
too many westerns.

230
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,965
Yeah, must be what...

231
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,125
A mile out?

232
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,363
Not on my best day...

233
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,765
Holy shit.

234
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,768
Okay, listen to me.

235
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,811
In-flec-tion. Right?
Listen, just listen to my tone.

236
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,804
I say, "Oh, I'm another year older,

237
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,567
"and I don't know if I'm ever gonna
get out of this fucking place."

238
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,210
And you say...

239
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,050
You're probably right, Francis.
You're extremely old.

240
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,565
- It's unlikely you'll survive to...
- No. No...

241
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,882
No. Hold on. That's not what you say.

242
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,046
Two years together every night, you know.

243
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,289
I gave you a PhD in black money,
but you gotta learn this.

244
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,169
- This is crucial.
- You're frustrated.

245
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,560
- What am I?
- You're frustrated.

246
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,721
That's what I am.

247
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,490
I'm frustrated. Good, good. Excellent.

248
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,968
Finally. All right. Let's do another one.

249
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,769
Lights out, ladies. Lights out.

250
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,570
Names and addresses. Go.

251
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,007
Semion Ivankov.
79 Primorsky Boulevard, Odessa.

252
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,768
The Meier brothers, Moshe and Itzhak.
221 She'arim Boulevard in Jerusalem.

253
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,685
Dominic Rabito of
960 Court Street, Brooklyn.

254
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,080
Ask for Bobby.

255
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,481
Ask for Bobby.

256
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,847
You know, I'm old.

257
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,288
I may be remembering things
a little rosier than they were.

258
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,531
I mean, you want to fill out 1040s
and itemize deductions,

259
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,762
and pull in 50 grand a year?
I mean, that's a living.

260
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,685
Because if you go down
this road, this road...

261
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,367
You can't go back, you understand?
It's dangerous. Do you understand?

262
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,601
I understand.

263
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,445
You find one person
you can trust, just one.

264
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,491
And do not make my mistake.
You keep moving your ass around.

265
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,202
They gave me a new handler today.

266
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,801
I don't like this guy. He's dull.

267
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,800
Worried.

268
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,325
Ah, fuck it.

269
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,364
Good night, son.

270
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,404
Good night, Francis.

271
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,561
What about Zurich? Saudi Arabia?

272
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,966
The Swiss are cheap.

273
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,487
Dubai is one thing, but we're
too conspicuous in the Kingdom.

274
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,727
I vote Chicago.

275
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,884
- Why?
- There's an uptick in online chatter.

276
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,201
People looking for you.

277
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,522
- What people?
- The unfriendly kind.

278
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,008
Let's try a legitimate client for once.

279
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,926
No cartels, arms brokers,
money launderers, assassins.

280
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,931
I like safe. I like you safe.

281
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,525
Everyone's hiding something.

282
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,444
At least there's honor among thieves.

283
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,763
There's honor among Illinois
electronics manufacturers.

284
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,690
They're in your current backyard.
No risk of movement. You'll meet?

285
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,721
Yeah, I'll meet.

286
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,930
One last piece of business.

287
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,241
Just the Renoir.

288
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,970
I don't have a buyer for the Renoir.

289
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,363
The Pollock can move.
Will you ever let it go?

290
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,761
Hello?

291
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,366
Just the Renoir. Drop the price.

292
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,245
Heavy sigh.

293
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,282
Go to work, dreamboat.

294
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,764
Now, Mr. Wolff, I half-suspect
we're wasting your time.

295
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,445
I'm quite sure you're not.

296
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,125
And you know this how?

297
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,884
I'm on the clock.

298
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,080
Shit.

299
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,083
I hope we're not wasting ours then.

300
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,405
Look, kidding aside, I think if you
saw our books, you'd run for the hills.

301
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,286
We have an incredibly complicated
accounting system.

302
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,920
Depreciation schedules
on hundreds of different items.

303
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,969
Full-time and contract employees.

304
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,122
Department of Defense classified accounts.

305
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,441
It's a numerical shitstorm.

306
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,444
I'll need to see all those books
for the past 10 years.

307
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,251
Bank statements, complete list
of clients and vendors.

308
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,364
Hard copies printed out, my eyes only.
All the information's right here.

309
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,840
Okay, well, well, look.

310
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,844
This all came to my attention
only last week.

311
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,970
Now, a junior cost accountant
stuck her nose where it didn't belong,

312
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,162
and obviously had no idea
what she was looking at.

313
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,602
Lamar's overreacting.
There's no missing money.

314
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,127
How long have you been CFO
of this company, sir?

315
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,361
15 years.

316
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,568
I need the books for the past 15, please.

317
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,122
Well, you're awful goddamn blunt!

318
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,806
I'm Lamar Blackburn's oldest friend.

319
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,961
I've been by his side

320
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,442
since he was turning out RC robots
that RadioShack called crap.

321
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,121
I wouldn't take a dime without his say-so.

322
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,041
You're angry.

323
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,531
Oh, this is bullshit.

324
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,324
Unusual way of making contact
with you, Mr. Wolff.

325
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,962
You were recommended by Mansoor Haqqani.

326
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,521
We custom-made prosthetics
for his youngest daughter.

327
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,924
You may know that she lost both legs

328
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,646
to a car bomb
outside his investment firm in Lahore.

329
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,485
He told my brother, Lamar, that you were
nothing short of supernatural.

330
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,051
Mr. Haqqani holds advanced degrees
in mathematics from Cambridge

331
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,043
and Caltech.

332
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,001
Why does a man like that need you?

333
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,367
I don't discuss client business.

334
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,524
What do you suppose that young man
is thinking right now?

335
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,762
"Why do I still feel my arm?"

336
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,160
I don't know.

337
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,682
"How did everything go so wrong, so fast?"

338
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,205
"It's cold. Turn up the heat."

339
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,606
Christian Wolff, I presume.

340
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,761
Mr. Blackburn.

341
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,200
Lamar.

342
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,801
Lamar.

343
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,281
Come with me.

344
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,126
Are you aware of Living Robotics'
three income streams?

345
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,601
Consumer electronics,
next generation prosthetics,

346
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,285
unmanned military applications.

347
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,370
Prosthetics division showed tremendous
growth over the last 10 years.

348
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,891
It seems to have matured.

349
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,681
Consumer products is your highest source
of revenue, followed closely

350
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,730
by Defense Department contracts
and prosthetics at two and three.

351
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,804
Yeah. You are well-informed.

352
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,401
I never married.

353
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,050
Never had kids.

354
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,328
This company is my child.

355
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,166
That said, money has never
been a motivation.

356
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,006
Balance sheets,
profit and loss statements...

357
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,320
My mind doesn't function
the way yours must.

358
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,044
I need you to be my eyes and ears, Chris.

359
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,966
Whatever you need to do your job,
you let me know.

360
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,844
I'll start in the morning.

361
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,203
Son of a bitch.

362
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,286
Bloody hell.

363
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,921
Excuse me...

364
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,567
Who the fuck do you think you are?

365
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,563
Do you know who the fuck I am?

366
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,725
Simon Dewey.

367
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,564
Founder, CEO, Dewey Capital.

368
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,965
American. Shocking.

369
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,046
I have kidnap insurance.
You obviously know that.

370
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,890
Sorry, but how in the world
would I know that you have...

371
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,565
You people fucking amaze me...

372
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,164
When you interrupt somebody like that,
it makes them feel

373
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,085
that you're just not interested
in what they have to say.

374
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,924
Or maybe you just think
what you have to say

375
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,082
is more important than what I have to say.

376
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,969
Is that what you think?

377
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,882
That gun makes you a big man, does it?

378
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,811
This gun? Simon, come on.

379
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,130
I'm part of a small but potent department
of a private security force.

380
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,648
We have a client, let's call it
a European manufacturing concern.

381
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,280
You're shorting their stock,
but simultaneously,

382
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,125
you're spreading false rumors
regarding the health of the company.

383
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,961
The resulting decline in the stock price,
it's made you your millions,

384
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,924
but it's been at my client's expense.

385
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,487
They have been forced
to cut hundreds of jobs, Simon.

386
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,122
These are third-generation metal workers,
people with families.

387
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,851
Pensions are being rendered worthless
because of you.

388
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,970
But you'll stop now. Correct?

389
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,961
Which company?

390
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,481
Wrong answer, Simon.

391
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,806
Look, genius...

392
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,601
That's the same spot, Simon.

393
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,127
Why you gonna let me hit you
in the same exact spot?

394
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,406
I only meant

395
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,802
we hold short positions
on dozens of companies.

396
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,121
Shit, son.

397
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,880
I suppose

398
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,725
you're spreading false information
about more than one company.

399
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,771
If that's what you're doing, you're just
gonna have to stop shorting them all.

400
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,645
That's ridiculous.
I can't be expected to...

401
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,409
Ooh, I know.

402
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,049
All right, get your chin up, Simon.
No pouting on my watch.

403
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,165
Yeah, you're a man. You just...

404
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,765
You're a man in your own way.

405
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,641
All right.

406
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,651
I'm an avid reader of the Journal.

407
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,168
So, I expect the cooperation
to be reflected there.

408
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,160
Simon?

409
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,760
Are we good?

410
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,241
Yeah?

411
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,242
Attaboy, Simon. Proud of you.

412
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,961
Oh, hello.

413
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,448
Good morning. Oh, shit... Hi.

414
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,127
- Hi.
- Um, um...

415
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,651
I'm Dana Cummings.
You're the consultant? Mr. Wolff?

416
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,650
- Chris.
- Hi, Chris, then.

417
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,966
I'm Dana.

418
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,406
Cummings.

419
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,810
Yes. Um...

420
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,482
These are all the files you wanted.

421
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,526
I cross-referenced them
by year, and alphabetically, so...

422
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,605
It must have taken you all night.

423
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,250
It sure did.

424
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,481
Hmm.

425
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,761
Right.

426
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,521
So...

427
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,161
So...

428
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,843
What do you want, Dana Cummings?

429
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,371
Oh, Mr. Blackburn, um...

430
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,964
Sorry, he said I should...

431
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,290
I'm the person
who first noticed the missing...

432
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,444
- What I think was the missing money.
- Yes, I understand. I'll find it.

433
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,966
Yeah. I thought we could... Have lunch...

434
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,645
I brought my own lunch.

435
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,961
No...

436
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,646
I bring my own lunch, too.

437
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,962
I can answer
any questions that you have...

438
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,202
I have no questions.

439
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,444
Yeah, okay. Yeah, you wanna
make your own assessment.

440
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,806
Yes, thank you.

441
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,123
Okay. Um...

442
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,486
I'm in accounting if you need anything.

443
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,165
There's, uh,

444
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,163
some donuts there for you.

445
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,163
I don't eat donuts.

446
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,001
Okay.

447
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,161
Mr. Secretary!

448
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,321
Yes, Helen.

449
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,123
Sir, there's been speculation that your
ability to link banks in South Florida

450
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,169
to money laundering efforts of terrorists

451
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,403
are actually the result of
a whistleblower or the NSA.

452
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,561
Care to comment?

453
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,843
Let me turn this over
to the head of my task force,

454
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,651
Financial Crimes Director, Raymond King.

455
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,889
Folks, there's no great mystery here.

456
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,686
Nothing fancy. Just team effort,

457
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,890
comprised of long hours of
good old-fashioned investigative work.

458
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,521
Questions?

459
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,604
Could you answer
the whistleblower question?

460
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,040
No.

461
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,725
Hey, Sorkis, give me something.

462
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,885
I matched the face in your Antwerp photo
to surveillance video in NYPD database.

463
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,884
Wait, wait, wait. NYPD? What did you find?

464
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,488
2006. Your guy takes out two mob enforcers

465
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,087
with a steak knife he lifted off
an Italian restaurant down the street.

466
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,769
Then he strolls into
a den of stone-cold killers

467
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,809
and goes on a seven-man killing spree,

468
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,405
using their own weapons.

469
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,809
Headshot, headshot, headshot.

470
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,081
Sorkis, stop.

471
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,561
A den of stone-cold killers? Where is this?

472
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,564
The Ravenite. Headquarters
of the Gambino crime family.

473
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,087
He killed Anthony "Little Tony" Bazzano.

474
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,291
Forensics lists cause of death
as blunt force trauma.

475
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,245
Your boy kicked him in the head once.

476
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,243
Again. Play it again.

477
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,164
Hey, hey, hey!

478
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,641
What the fuck?

479
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,688
Wait! I gotta call it in!

480
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,363
I've also got an audio file here.

481
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,443
Inside of the Ravenite was bugged.

482
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,841
Come on.

483
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,681
Please.

484
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,330
That's Little Tony.

485
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,926
I'm fucking begging you.

486
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,646
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

487
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,006
Okay, get me that recording ASAP.

488
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,366
I wasn't even...

489
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,641
M.B.,

490
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,122
you're an analyst for Treasury.

491
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,841
What the hell have you got yourself into?

492
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,811
What do you have to hit
to dent a steel thermos?

493
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,491
It's just old.

494
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,083
How did you, um,
get into financial consulting?

495
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,130
Department of Labor statistics indicate

496
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,408
it's one of
the fastest-growing professions.

497
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,924
Actuarial sciences are experiencing
tremendous growth as well.

498
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,526
Okay.

499
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,771
I like the balance of it.

500
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,686
You know, I like finding things
that aren't obvious.

501
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,522
Plus, my dad was an accountant.

502
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,521
He actually...

503
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,729
You know, he had the whole shtick.
The, uh...

504
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,522
You know, the little amortization book,
and the green eyeshade,

505
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,768
and the, like,
dorky pocket protector and...

506
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,570
I have a pocket protector.

507
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,649
That's a nice one.
I mean, his was dorky, that's...

508
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,245
Yours is nice.

509
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,443
Um, but he convinced me
to go into the field.

510
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,967
Because I wanted to study art
at the Art Institute of Chicago,

511
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,762
but art doesn't pay the mortgage.

512
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,048
"Art doesn't pay the mortgage,
young lady."

513
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,406
Dad's tastes ran more to
Dogs Playing Poker.

514
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,050
I like Dogs Playing Poker.

515
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,242
Because dogs would never bet on things,

516
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,482
and so, it's incongruous.

517
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,922
I like incongruity.

518
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,766
Yeah, Dogs Playing Poker is nice.
It's just sort of a...

519
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,610
Just different.

520
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,561
So, I studied accounting
at the University of Chicago,

521
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,767
where fun goes to die.

522
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,921
Why?

523
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,920
Why what?

524
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,164
Why does fun go to die
at the University of Chicago?

525
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,843
Oh, no, it's just an expression.

526
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,801
I'm joking.

527
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,841
Right.

528
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,241
- Um, I'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

529
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,801
Let me know if you need anything
while you're here.

530
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,281
Have a nice day.

531
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,930
Yes. You, too.

532
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,971
Explain the 376, 109...
6,500,000... 6,008,000...

533
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,210
Accounts receivable,
earnings before interest...

534
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,209
Tax, depreciation,
administrative expenses...

535
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,360
100, 644,000...

536
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,809
Hydraulic sync systems,
aluminum bar supplies,

537
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,803
techmod fitting, stable joints...

538
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,246
Please.

539
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,251
I'm fucking begging you.

540
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,210
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

541
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,566
I wasn't even...

542
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,290
Okay.

543
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,411
Give me something.

544
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,521
Please.

545
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,646
...fucking begging you.

546
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,121
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

547
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,041
I wasn't even...

548
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,203
Come on, come on, come on.

549
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,241
...begging you.

550
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,484
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

551
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,451
Born on a Monday

552
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,724
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

553
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,006
Solomon Grundy

554
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,045
Born on Monday

555
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,364
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

556
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,846
Solomon Grundy

557
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,005
Come in! Come in, come in, come in.
You have to see this. Look at this.

558
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,123
It's gonna blow you away.

559
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,523
I mean, it'll just jump right out at you.

560
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,647
There it is.

561
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,961
Uh-huh.

562
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,651
Living Robotics, 10 years ago.

563
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,966
Earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation.

564
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,930
$14,495,719.

565
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,161
Nine years ago,

566
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,371
earnings before tax and depreciation...

567
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,242
Revenues go up, profits go down.

568
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,649
Down? No large capital expenditures
dragging profits down.

569
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,121
No spike in raw materials or labor costs.

570
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,567
Year eight,
profits and revenue both go up,

571
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,210
but not in a commensurate fashion.

572
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,561
X no longer equals Y.

573
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,610
Six, five, four, three.
You're making money.

574
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,761
But there's a leak.

575
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,805
And the leak is...

576
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,203
Leak, where's the leak? Here.

577
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,764
Slewitt Manufacturing.
I've signed these checks.

578
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,405
- Who authorized it?
- Ed.

579
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,325
Mr. Chilton. They make electronic
assemblies for the consumer division.

580
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,961
No, they don't. Look at this.

581
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,724
You notice anything?

582
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,130
- Second number in each is a three.
- Yes.

583
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,203
Most people,
when generating random numbers

584
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,805
tend to rely subconsciously

585
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,086
- on certain patterns.
- Patterns, yeah.

586
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,241
Yes.

587
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,566
- I was right!
- You were right.

588
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,161
Yeah.

589
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,285
I went through these ledgers for months,
and I got through one fiscal year.

590
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,044
You went through 15 overnight?

591
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,287
That's not even the best part, look.

592
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,088
The best part is, they're routing money
to a company that doesn't exist.

593
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,244
And yet, profits go up.
And they continue going up.

594
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,606
Absolutely makes no sense.

595
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,808
- Where's the money coming from?
- Exactly!

596
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,606
Um, it's not inventory?

597
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,921
Inventory turns. No.

598
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,242
- Chargebacks to vendors?
- No. Perfectly in order.

599
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,767
- Internal offsets?
- No. That's a terrible idea.

600
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,565
Um...

601
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,244
Cummings, you're needed in

602
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,602
whatever area I'm paying you
to be needed in.

603
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,761
Sorry.

604
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,647
And?

605
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,440
$61,679,000.

606
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,651
And some change.

607
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,768
Who did it? Best guess.

608
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,524
I don't guess.

609
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,681
You'll have a report for me?

610
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,849
When I'm finished, yes.

611
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,329
- Hey, Ed.
- What the...

612
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,883
We're having lemon merengue pie.

613
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,088
Those two bottles of insulin.

614
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,365
You know, I just thought

615
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,048
that you would appreciate me
treating you like an adult, right?

616
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,924
So, here's what I got.

617
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,201
You administer your own accidental
insulin overdose, and just...

618
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,401
Die.

619
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,005
But do it with dignity.

620
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,928
Your wife, who's sleeping upstairs,
she'll be the beneficiary

621
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,051
of what's gotta be a very generous
insurance policy, am I right?

622
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,487
But the only way she's gonna
collect on that policy, Ed,

623
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,246
is if we have the appearance
of an accident.

624
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,206
If we lay our hands on you,
you're gonna fight, squeal.

625
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,050
She wakes up, my hands are tied.

626
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,441
One accidental death is just that,
but two, no.

627
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,602
I'll have no choice.

628
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,525
I'll have to rock and roll
a home invasion,

629
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,444
violate your wife a dozen different ways,

630
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,841
kill you both,
burn the place to the ground.

631
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,326
I'm sorry for that. Ed, Ed, Ed?

632
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,962
Hey, nobody's gonna
violate your wife, okay?

633
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,922
Aside from what that would say
about me as a human being,

634
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,568
physiologically it's a non-starter.

635
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,890
Sometimes I think I just say shit,
sample what comes out of my mouth.

636
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,846
I will, however,
park a .45 in her brainpan.

637
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,250
I honor my commitments.

638
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,448
It's a concept you and your sticky fingers
probably find hard to grasp.

639
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,323
Make a decision, sir.

640
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,167
Where are you going? Sir?

641
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,001
Sir?

642
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,088
Stop that. Why are you doing that?
Stop that.

643
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,084
Sir? Sir? What are you doing? Excuse me?

644
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,890
Mr. Chilton passed away.

645
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,448
I was told to clean up the room.

646
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,641
What's happening?

647
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,809
Can you give us a minute, please?

648
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,524
This is the balance of your contract.

649
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,529
- I understand you're upset...
- Yes, I'm upset.

650
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,681
I haven't finished yet.

651
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,126
Yes, you have.

652
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,489
Ed was a diabetic for 30 years.

653
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,768
You think he didn't know
how to check his blood sugar?

654
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,004
Whatever unresolved issues remain,

655
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,448
my friend was poisoned enough by them
to take his own life.

656
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,522
As far as I'm concerned,
whatever he did is forgiven.

657
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,088
Please. I need to finish, please.

658
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,527
- Sorry, I'll come back.
- No, no, come in, dear.

659
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,045
We're done.

660
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,086
You're very good, Mr. Wolff.

661
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,811
But I hope our paths never cross again.

662
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,324
I'm responsible
for the death of my best friend.

663
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,771
I'd prefer not to be reminded of it.

664
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,288
Do you think that's true?

665
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,128
That Mr. Chilton killed himself...

666
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,888
I mean, do you think we're responsible?

667
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,284
It's very hard for me to interpret
why people do what they do.

668
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,401
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished with this.

669
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,002
I mean, look... Look at this.

670
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,807
See, cost reports. This is out of order.

671
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,964
They completely rearranged this.
I don't...

672
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,528
I'm not finished. I'm not finished...

673
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,040
Bye, Chris.

674
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,810
No! Mom! Mom!

675
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,844
Mom! Mom! Mom!

676
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,563
Why is Mom leaving?

677
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,200
Mom!

678
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,601
Again.

679
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,767
Again.

680
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,161
Enough.

681
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,601
They're not done.

682
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,408
Tomorrow is another day.
They have done their best.

683
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,841
If that were true, you'd be covered
in blood and snot, not them.

684
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,325
Keep going.

685
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,805
Aggression, correctly channeled,
overcomes a lot of flaws.

686
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,121
Tapping into that aggression requires

687
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,884
peeling back several layers of yourself.

688
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,810
It's my job to know my sons' limitations.

689
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,846
Get up.

690
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,131
It's your job to peel.

691
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,608
Do your job. On your feet.

692
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,641
Again!

693
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,728
We could have went to his house,
shot him in his home.

694
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,564
And we'd be on a plane by now.

695
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,963
Or on a security camera,
or some nosy neighbor's iPhone.

696
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,366
Call the bookkeeper in.

697
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,371
He's just too far. He won't hear...

698
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,646
Now.

699
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,531
Let's go. Get up. Come on.

700
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,326
Move!

701
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,005
Come on, come on, come on.

702
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,371
Christian!

703
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,121
Chris!

704
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,362
Again! Louder!

705
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,081
Up! Up!

706
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,290
- No, no! Please!
- What the fuck?

707
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,441
Dolores!

708
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,207
She's coming with me.

709
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,725
No, no, stop! Stop! Leave her...

710
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,526
We're all going together.
Pull that truck around back.

711
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,409
Let's go! Let's go!

712
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,241
Let's move!

713
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,967
Come on! Drive! Drive now!

714
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,771
Jesus fucking Christ!

715
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,081
God damn it!

716
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,846
Son of a bitch!

717
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,360
What the fuck?

718
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,525
When I say the name of your employer,
you say "yes."

719
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,721
Practice.

720
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,887
Yes.

721
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,881
Camorra.

722
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,561
Ju\E1rez.

723
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,206
Gambino.

724
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,286
Do you understand the rules?

725
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,847
My left pocket.

726
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,923
They paid to

727
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,846
kill you both.

728
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,161
That's all I know.

729
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,683
- Hello, dreamboat.
- Dana's in danger.

730
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,411
Kill Christian Wolff,
transfer all domestic accounts overseas.

731
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,602
- Current vehicle?
- F-150.

732
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,482
- Virus to triple Z?
- Wipe everything.

733
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,609
Done. In the DOT database now.

734
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,689
Reassigning the license and VIN.

735
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,366
I have George Boole
or Charles Babbage in the queue.

736
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,284
Boole. Obviously.

737
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,044
Silly of me. What else?

738
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,325
She is not your problem.

739
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,926
Straight to the trailer,
hook it up, and disappear.

740
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,360
There's no time.

741
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,851
Only the trailer.

742
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,566
Address and phone number. Get it.

743
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,126
She's not answering.

744
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,041
Could have used the small box.

745
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,049
Well, she looked bigger in the photo.

746
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,041
God!

747
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,164
God damn!

748
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,521
Bitch!

749
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,401
Fuck.

750
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,120
We should go.

751
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,850
Since when are accountants
difficult to ventilate?

752
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,685
Dead?

753
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,844
Christ! What'd he do, hit him
over the head with an adding machine?

754
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,360
Oh, God.

755
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,810
All right, just put me in touch
with the client.

756
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,201
I'll handle this accountant myself.

757
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,971
Running isn't an option for me.
I can't just walk out on my life!

758
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,363
We have to go to the police.
That's what normal, taxpaying people do!

759
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,525
Police can't protect you from someone
who can afford to return $61 million.

760
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,370
Return?
What are you talking about, "return"?

761
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,284
The money was being put back.

762
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,601
Stay here.

763
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,241
What are you doing in here?

764
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,561
- Who are you?
- You can't...

765
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,846
You should not be here.

766
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,923
Sit down. Sit right there.

767
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,205
What is this place?

768
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,881
PanAmerica, Airstream.

769
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,806
34 feet 7 inches long,

770
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,203
8 feet 5 inches wide.

771
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,804
Dimensions which are perfectly adequate
for one person.

772
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,405
Preferable, even.

773
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,930
This is where you live?

774
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,924
No, I don't live here.
This is a storage unit.

775
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,081
That would be weird.

776
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,651
That's what would be weird?

777
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,201
I'd like to spend more time here.

778
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,131
However, I'm afraid some of my clients
might follow me.

779
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,407
Why would your clients follow you?
You're an accountant!

780
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,164
How do you know what to do here?
Why are you prepared for this?

781
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,810
Plus, this is on wheels,

782
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,201
which means I can hook it up
and be gone in 12 minutes.

783
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,361
Usually.

784
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,570
Sarcasm? Is that sarcasm?

785
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,405
No, that's not sarcasm.
I don't use sarcasm. It's irritation.

786
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,006
Everything in the world that is
important to me is in this trailer.

787
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,447
And right now, changing my routine
for you is jeopardizing that.

788
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,682
Tell me that's not an original Pollock.

789
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,921
We should go.

790
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,286
Now.

791
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,124
- Medina.
- Miss Medina?

792
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,045
This is Gordon Amundson
with the FBI Language Services.

793
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,009
Uh, yeah. Any luck?

794
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,288
It's an unusual audio file.

795
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,047
Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme
circa mid-1800s.

796
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,567
Your voice has four of
the six intonation patterns

797
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,563
we use to define American English.

798
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,007
That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.

799
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,883
Out of curiosity,
was your subject a trauma victim?

800
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,969
Um, why do you ask that?

801
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,487
Well, you indicated on your submission

802
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:30,371
that this event occurred
in a high-stress environment?

803
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,409
Yeah. Exceptionally.

804
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,971
That's interesting.

805
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,642
The verse was repeated
a total of four and a halftimes

806
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:44,046
with zero variation in pitch, span, tempo,
volume, or articulatory precision.

807
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,929
So, what does that mean, exactly?

808
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,560
Well, we often see
this type of repetitive chanting

809
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,922
in children
who have been exposed to trauma

810
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,003
or persons with
neurodevelopmental disorders.

811
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,363
Neurodevelopmental disorders?

812
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,767
Fragile-X syndrome, autism.

813
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,851
Okay, so...

814
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,764
Let's say I was looking at mugshots.

815
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,447
How would that present itself?
What exactly would I be looking for?

816
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:10,208
Fragile-X: Elongated face,
protruding ears, poor muscle tone.

817
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,411
Autism's nearly impossible
to identify visually.

818
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,130
The traits are behavioral:

819
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,090
difficulty with
social interaction, communication,

820
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,089
lack of eye contact.

821
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,126
Lack of eye contact.

822
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,125
Okay.

823
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,281
Good luck to you.

824
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,441
Thanks.

825
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,010
None of this makes sense.

826
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,323
Why go through the trouble of skimming
the money if you're gonna put it back?

827
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,681
Over the last two years,

828
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,925
the number of invoices submitted
by Slewitt Manufacturing declined.

829
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,651
Scared of getting caught?

830
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,646
Price hikes?

831
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,962
Prices of consumer electronics
go down, not up.

832
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,322
Right, down, yeah.

833
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,486
I can't afford this.

834
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,290
I know. My treat.

835
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,964
In the US, 104 men,

836
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,364
last name any standard derivation
of your mathematician, Carl Gauss,

837
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:58,970
reported over $500,000
in any of the last seven years.

838
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,804
Okay. Go a million plus.

839
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,526
Seventeen.

840
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,207
Of the 17, how many between
the ages of 25 and 45?

841
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,041
Four.

842
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,527
Of those four,

843
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,480
only one has an income stream
that's cash-heavy or easily laundered.

844
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,801
And he

845
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,889
died three years ago.

846
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,801
What's this?

847
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,480
It's names of
the 100 most famous mathematicians.

848
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,640
Look, we know what we're doing now.

849
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:36,242
So, just enter the names,
narrow down the search right off the bat.

850
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,845
Male, Caucasian,

851
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,606
25 to 45, earning a million plus.

852
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,889
No investment income.
He'll concentrate on cash.

853
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,366
What's in it for me?

854
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,888
Look, if you help me find him,

855
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,849
I'll see what I can do
about getting you outta here.

856
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,440
Please.

857
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,529
Single earner or filing jointly?

858
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,769
Hey, those paintings in your trailer...

859
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,282
- They're real, right?
- Yes.

860
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,888
You didn't buy them at auction, did you?

861
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,769
They're a form of payment.

862
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,801
Right.

863
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,121
Hey.

864
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,971
Thank you.

865
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,606
At my apartment.

866
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,761
Oh.

867
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,881
Yeah.

868
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,444
Can we sit down for a second?

869
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,287
Yeah. Okay.

870
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,641
Just...

871
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,286
Sit.

872
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,687
How do you, um,

873
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,968
know how to...

874
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,966
My father was an officer in the Army.
Psychological Operations.

875
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,206
He was concerned that I might be
taken advantage of somehow,

876
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,809
so he arranged for me to train
with a number of specialists

877
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,325
throughout my childhood.

878
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,405
We lived in 34 homes in 17 years.

879
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,289
- You moved 34 times?
- Mmm-hmm.

880
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,564
God. That's extraordinary.

881
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,561
No, I'm sure
it must've been difficult, but...

882
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,925
I haven't been anywhere.

883
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,043
Well, Cancun. Not my proudest moment.

884
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,881
Um...

885
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,085
I just mean...

886
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,880
Your life is unique.

887
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,085
It's not unique. I have
a high-functioning form of autism,

888
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,964
which means I have
an extremely narrow focus

889
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:23,090
and a hard time abandoning tasks
once I've taken them up.

890
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,404
I have difficulty socializing
with other people, even though

891
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,171
I want to.

892
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,083
When I was a senior in high school,
I wanted this special dress for prom.

893
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,770
I told myself that spending $100 on a
trashy dress that I was gonna wear one time

894
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,968
to an event that I thought was
silly in the first place, was...

895
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,367
- Wasteful.
- Yes.

896
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:54,009
But Vera Wang
made this black, strapless classic.

897
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,766
It was more expensive, but you could
wear it to all kinds of future events.

898
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,644
- It was an investment.
- Yes.

899
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,729
Where were you when I was in high school?

900
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,127
Oh, North Carolina, Israel.

901
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,121
Right. Um...

902
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,208
The problem was
they wanted $1700 for this dress,

903
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,441
and I didn't have that, so...

904
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,165
- You asked your parents?
- No.

905
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,040
Hang on.

906
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,491
Blackjack. I'd never played a hand,

907
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,120
but I went to the library, and I
checked out all these books on strategy.

908
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,800
And I turned the Naperville North
math club into a little Vegas.

909
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,962
- What's a math club?
- Math club?

910
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,850
You compete against other schools.

911
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,002
Theory and speed math.

912
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,283
Like, what's 298,567 times 92?

913
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,641
27,468, 164.

914
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,166
Right. Um...

915
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,561
Blackjack.

916
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,563
I could tell you
when to hit, stand, split, re-split.

917
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,849
I moved on to card counting,
shuffle tracking, hole carding.

918
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,721
And I took everything I had,
which was $183,

919
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,690
and I drove down to Harrah's in Joliet.

920
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,365
Why was this dress so important to you?

921
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,204
It wasn't about the dress.

922
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:13,803
I just wanted to walk into the gym
and have everybody say "Wow!"

923
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,042
I was trying to belong.

924
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,323
I was trying to connect.

925
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,050
I think no matter how different we are,
we're all trying to do the same thing.

926
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:36,042
But I lost all but $20
in the first 10 minutes.

927
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,726
I fed that into a nickel slot
on the way out,

928
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,882
- and I won two grand.
- Hmm.

929
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,407
I used the extra cash to pay for a limo.

930
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,841
Only wore the dress the one time.

931
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,242
Chris, why are we here?

932
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,241
Um...

933
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,201
I thought this hotel
had good water pressure.

934
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,764
The Holiday Inn Express in Aurora
has good water pressure.

935
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,605
Yes, but these towels are very fancy,

936
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,645
and cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.

937
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,491
And

938
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,090
I wanted you to like it.

939
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,768
Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.

940
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,485
Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump.
Have you ever heard of...

941
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,961
- What?
- Crazy Eddie Antar.

942
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,170
He owned a string of electronic stores
in New York City in the '80s.

943
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,842
Crazy Eddie Antar, he started stealing
almost as soon as he opened business.

944
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,126
Okay, I'm not following.

945
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,964
He deposited money in Tel Aviv,

946
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:05,090
and then he cycled it through Panama
and put it back into his stores.

947
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,685
Okay, why take it out and put it back?

948
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,969
Well, initially he was just stealing
in garden-variety tax evasion,

949
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,327
but then he came up with a better idea.

950
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,403
You see, by taking his own money,

951
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,961
stealing it, and putting it back
on his books...

952
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,605
He was raining cash.

953
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,683
He took the company public at $8 a share.

954
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,525
A year later, it was trading at $75.

955
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,528
- Rita's taking Living Robotics public.
- Yes.

956
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,409
But why would she hire you
in the first place

957
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,642
if she thought you would figure it out?

958
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,206
I don't know.

959
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,205
I'll have to ask her.

960
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,163
Whatever Rita's involvement,
it's not your concern.

961
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,368
You disappear, I make a call.

962
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,409
Please. I worry about you.

963
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,006
If I don't do something, Dana will die.

964
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,527
Risking your life for a girl
you've known a week.

965
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,681
Why?

966
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,565
Heavy sigh.

967
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,210
What's the plan?

968
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,488
Find the person who wants to kill her.

969
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,847
And?

970
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,805
Shoot them in the head.

971
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,286
Last one.

972
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,126
Wolff, two "F"s, Christian.

973
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,848
Two hundred and forty five men.

974
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,682
Four with incomes over a million.

975
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,566
All over the age of 60. Sorry.

976
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,849
Right. Your guy's an accountant.

977
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,203
Two Christian Wolffs own CPA firms.

978
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,204
The first Christian Wolff owns...

979
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,162
Wolff Accounting. 121 South Street,
Scottsdale, Arizona.

980
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,211
Income of 435 grand. It's a good year.

981
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,044
So good, we audited him two years ago.

982
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,361
He's clean.

983
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,488
The other Christian Wolff...

984
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,610
Nope. Only 75 grand.

985
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,206
ZZZ Accounting.

986
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,567
Wabash Way, Plainfield, Illinois.

987
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,881
ZZZ.

988
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,567
I mean, it's not exactly
a smart Yellow Pages move.

989
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,285
Wait a second.

990
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,569
Who filed the returns for
Kim's Nails, Wabash Way, Plainfield?

991
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,245
ZZZ Accounting.
Could just be the neighborly...

992
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,768
Great Mandarin, Wabash.

993
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,921
ZZZ Accounting.

994
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,445
Paul's Laundromat.

995
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,810
ZZZ Accounting.

996
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,567
Tell me they're all
registered as partnerships.

997
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,887
Every one.

998
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,925
Managing partner...

999
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,241
Christian Wolff.

1000
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,569
- Christian Wolff.
- Come in.

1001
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:23,282
Christian Wolff, last year, ran $75,543
through his accounting firm.

1002
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,487
Whoa. Who is Christian Wolff?

1003
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,165
The accountant.

1004
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,882
- 75 grand? That's chump change.
- Agreed.

1005
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:36,729
But he ran another $287,765
through Kim's Nails,

1006
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,522
$445, 112 through Great Mandarin Chinese,
and you'll love this,

1007
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,004
$505,909 through Paul's Laundromat.

1008
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,651
Paul's Laundromat?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1009
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,847
He's playing with us.

1010
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,527
He can't clean that kind of money
through an accounting firm.

1011
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,205
The paper trail's too heavy.

1012
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,010
So, he's laundering it
through cash businesses.

1013
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,731
All of those are in the same strip mall
south of Chicago.

1014
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,161
ZZZ?

1015
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,483
I mean, he doesn't care about the traffic.
It's a front. All of it.

1016
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,167
Christian Wolff, Carl Gauss,
Lou "Lewis" Carroll.

1017
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,483
He's using the names
of famous mathematicians as a cover.

1018
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,041
Charitable contributions here
to Harbor Neuroscience.

1019
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,328
Last year alone,
that's gotta come to close to...

1020
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,931
$1,000,100.

1021
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,845
That one's not a cover.
That's the real deal. I checked.

1022
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,604
So, you're telling me
this guy risks his life

1023
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,560
doing forensic accounting for some
of the scariest people on the planet,

1024
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,166
collects his fee, goes through
all the trouble of laundering it,

1025
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,129
and then gives almost all of it away?

1026
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,690
Well, what if
he's taking other means of payment?

1027
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,724
Yeah, possible. Yeah.

1028
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,050
I caught him, Ray.

1029
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,040
Maybe.

1030
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,208
Pack a bag. We're going to Chicago.

1031
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,282
90% probability they're all right-handed.

1032
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,282
Up to me, I'd snap four right wrists.

1033
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,127
But maybe you enjoy waiting
on a schoolyard sucker punch.

1034
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,568
Life is a series of choices,
none of which are new.

1035
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,370
The oldest is choosing to be a victim.

1036
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,204
Or choosing not to.

1037
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,802
Second oldest: loyalty.

1038
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,643
Family first, good times or bad.

1039
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,842
Bonjour, fellas.

1040
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,209
They're only glasses.

1041
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:58,008
You think if you don't fight back,
then maybe they'll like you.

1042
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,771
Stop picking on you, calling you "freak."

1043
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,090
Well, here's what it is.

1044
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,244
They don't like you,
they don't dislike you.

1045
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,445
They're afraid of you.

1046
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,365
You're different.

1047
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,011
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.

1048
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,047
Victim or not? Make a decision.

1049
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,407
Go.

1050
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,770
You're different.

1051
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,844
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.

1052
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,525
In here.

1053
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,762
.357 Colt Python.

1054
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,170
Serial number's gone.

1055
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,881
Hydra-Shoks.

1056
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,929
Wireless security cam.

1057
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,241
Infrared, weatherproof.

1058
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,289
He's got a network of 'em.

1059
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,602
Whole backyard's got eyes.

1060
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,960
This is our guy.

1061
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,329
So, why does a guy who's
up to his elbows in cash live here?

1062
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,889
Given his clientele, he figures
blending in will extend his shelf life.

1063
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,169
It's the smart move.

1064
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,688
Well, maybe not smart enough.

1065
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,086
High-tech security cameras back here,

1066
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,562
anybody could roll up in the front.

1067
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,889
How does he cover this?

1068
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,247
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

1069
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,609
Don't see that every day.

1070
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,485
Boys, let's have a situation report.

1071
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,561
We good, Ike?

1072
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,291
All clear.

1073
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,566
Rock and roll.

1074
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,809
And how about you, sport?

1075
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,605
It's Bobby.

1076
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,090
I got nothing.

1077
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,925
Okay, yeah, I'm getting
a feed on the camera now.

1078
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,491
Move it to the left side.

1079
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,445
Is all this really necessary?

1080
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,525
You should be watching his home.

1081
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,806
Yeah? What you think?

1082
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,924
That's your idea on the subject?

1083
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,771
Love it when people tell me
how to do my job.

1084
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,763
I believe I recommended
you leave the country.

1085
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,605
- You declined.
- He's an accountant!

1086
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,687
I could see it in his eyes.
The freak wasn't gonna let it go.

1087
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,806
My best to Michelle.

1088
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,166
I will.

1089
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,645
I was old 10 years ago.

1090
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,802
So, what's your story, Medina?

1091
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,491
You know my story.

1092
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,007
I know what the courts said.

1093
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:23,520
Stuffed a handful of cocaine
up a drug dealer's nose,

1094
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:26,160
pistol-whipped him
into the trunk of his car.

1095
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,723
I was 17. It was August.

1096
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:34,927
He cooked for three days, but lived.

1097
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,531
Do you regret it?

1098
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,160
The coke was half borax.

1099
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,047
Same shit he kept selling my sister.

1100
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,004
She's a dental hygienist in Annapolis now.

1101
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,208
Married, three kids.

1102
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,445
No, I don't regret it.

1103
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,370
That's rough.

1104
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,568
All due respect, Director King,

1105
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,200
what the fuck do you know about "rough"?

1106
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,928
Wait! I gotta call it in!

1107
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,081
Move it!

1108
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,890
You tell me, Medina.

1109
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,290
Men kill each other
for any number of reasons.

1110
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,561
Bobby, you hear me?

1111
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,405
Money, power...

1112
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,807
Fear.

1113
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,325
Right there, motherfucker!

1114
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,849
Nine men would die
that day at the Ravenite,

1115
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,200
but for none of those reasons.

1116
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,922
No, they'd taken something
from the man who was killing them.

1117
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,086
Something that couldn't
be made whole again.

1118
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,922
Something very important to him.

1119
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,807
And he was there for his pound of flesh.

1120
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,485
Please.

1121
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,091
Just fucking stop, man!

1122
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,890
Just put the gun down!

1123
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,164
Little Tony Bazzano.

1124
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,681
I'd been wedged in a van for six months

1125
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,810
listening to that arrogant little prick
belch, fart, and brag.

1126
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,361
Please.

1127
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,965
I'm fucking begging you.

1128
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,925
I didn't recognize his voice
with all the fear in it.

1129
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,930
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

1130
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,281
I wasn't even...

1131
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,964
Our man had come for revenge.

1132
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,810
And he got it.

1133
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,171
Nine dead.

1134
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,485
And I was 10.

1135
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,087
Your name?

1136
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,886
Ray.

1137
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,724
Raymond King.

1138
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,121
Who employs you, Raymond King?

1139
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,650
I'm a Treasury agent.

1140
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,010
Are you a good one?

1141
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,606
No.

1142
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,330
No, not particularly.

1143
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:04,720
Is that it?

1144
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,844
Kids, I got... I'm a dad.

1145
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,525
I got two kids.

1146
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,366
Grown?

1147
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,001
Yeah.

1148
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,604
Yes, yes, they're all...
They're all grown up.

1149
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,926
Were you a good dad, Raymond King?

1150
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:31,166
Yeah. I've been a good dad.

1151
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,847
I'm a lousy agent,
and I've been a weak man,

1152
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,528
but that I didn't screw up.

1153
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,684
That I got right.

1154
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,091
Imagine you're a Treasury agent

1155
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:04,450
approaching the twilight
of a spectacularly dismal career.

1156
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:10,608
And then one day, that break
you should have been looking for.

1157
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,889
Francis Silverberg, a black money legend.

1158
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,567
Cleaned cash from Monte Carlo
to Havana to Vegas.

1159
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,805
He cooked the books for the Gambino family
for 40-plus years.

1160
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,406
Until one day, the boss, Big Tony Bazzano,

1161
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,087
thought maybe the old man's age
made him vulnerable to prosecution.

1162
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:32,289
Ordered his son, Little Tony,
to kill Francis.

1163
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,286
Kid fucked it up.

1164
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:38,684
Francis ran, became a federal informant
in return for protective custody.

1165
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,960
Could have turned my career around

1166
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,770
if only I'd listened.

1167
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,920
I didn't.

1168
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:51,166
He was processed out,
and he lost the only protection he had.

1169
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,685
Stand clear of the gate.

1170
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:57,767
The protection that he was promised
when he testified against Big Tony.

1171
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,645
And this time, Little Tony got it right.

1172
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,608
He had Francis in a couple hours.

1173
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:12,011
Down in a filthy basement in the Bronx,
nailed to a chair,

1174
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,449
tortured to death.

1175
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:23,128
So, I volunteered for a joint task force.

1176
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,564
Sat outside the Ravenite
in a surveillance van for months

1177
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,849
hoping to get a shred of evidence
to use against Francis' killers.

1178
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:34,641
Wait! Wait!

1179
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,126
I gotta call it in!

1180
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:38,967
Move it!

1181
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,640
I went in there hoping
I could ease my guilt.

1182
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,644
And I met our accountant.

1183
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,051
Why he let me live, I didn't know.

1184
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:53,289
But he changed my life.

1185
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,688
Gave my notice at the Department.

1186
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,331
I started looking forward
to the day again.

1187
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,211
You know, feeling the sun on my face.

1188
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,330
Quit drinking.

1189
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:09,689
Was on my way out the door...

1190
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,845
And then, the phone rang.

1191
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:14,521
Ray King.

1192
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,170
I'll never forget that voice.

1193
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,567
Do you like puzzles, Raymond King?

1194
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,207
She tells me she works for the accountant.

1195
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:27,448
And that a shipping container
packed with Chinese nationals

1196
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,285
is passing through the Port of New York.

1197
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,445
Few months later,

1198
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:36,764
one ton of uncut Ju\E1rez cartel product
is entering Miami.

1199
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,531
All those cases you put together...

1200
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,371
Smoke and mirrors.

1201
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,725
So, who is he?

1202
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,241
This accountant.

1203
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:56,121
Prisoner 831.
Fort Leavenworth, maximum security.

1204
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,560
Military prison?

1205
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,891
So, he was in the Army?

1206
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:04,484
Army lent him to us to track
al-Qaeda money launderers.

1207
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:09,247
He was transferred from Leavenworth
to our detention center in D.C.

1208
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,723
Did the work of five men.

1209
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,123
Data mining, cluster analysis.

1210
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,290
He roomed with Francis.

1211
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:22,451
They kept to themselves, played chess,

1212
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,082
ate together, sat in the TV room together.

1213
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,965
They were inseparable.

1214
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,290
And then one day, a guard told Wolff

1215
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:35,808
why Francis hadn't called or written
since he got out.

1216
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,246
That his burnt body had been found
in a Staten Island landfill.

1217
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:45,408
Wolff snapped, went after the guard.

1218
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,764
He fractured the man's skull
with a thermos.

1219
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,523
Escaped from a third-floor window.

1220
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,285
Took the thermos.

1221
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,208
That's all you got? I mean, Leavenworth,
he'll have military records...

1222
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,044
Records are all heavily redacted.

1223
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,964
Well, then arrest records, something?

1224
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:06,491
Spring of 2003, at a funeral home
in Kankakee, Illinois.

1225
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:12,204
Our boy sends six locals to the hospital
with a variety of injuries.

1226
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,325
No one knew Wolff.

1227
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,289
The older man who came with him
was identified as a colonel, US Army.

1228
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,811
A funeral home.

1229
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,811
Whose wake?

1230
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,202
One customer that day.

1231
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,528
Mrs. Lauren Alton.

1232
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,805
Mrs. Alton taught first grade
for 13 years in Kankakee.

1233
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:43,487
Survived by a husband
and two boys, ages 12 and 10.

1234
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,043
By all accounts,
an ordinary life, well lived.

1235
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,330
But cut short.

1236
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,686
It'll be all right.

1237
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,681
Excuse me, sir, this is family only.

1238
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:01,845
Sir, I'm going to ask you to step outside.

1239
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:06,764
And then a fight breaks out.
A brawl, really.

1240
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,083
Over what,
the authorities never pinned down.

1241
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,361
Get your hands...

1242
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,210
Deputies respond.

1243
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:22,768
A Barney Fife-type squares off
with our boy, gets rattled, pulls his gun.

1244
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,887
The colonel just stepped in front of 831.

1245
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,405
Army collects both men.

1246
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,210
Police report names Wolff
as "Soldier One."

1247
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,610
And widower
identified the colonel by name.

1248
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,362
His late wife's former husband.

1249
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,803
I checked. It's an alias.

1250
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,921
No more real than "Christian Wolff."

1251
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:52,291
She was the dead colonel's ex-wife.

1252
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,406
And you think Wolff is what to him?

1253
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:07,323
Were you a good dad, Ray King?

1254
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,764
I've given up trying to figure out
when I'll get a call.

1255
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,764
The "why" though, that I've got.

1256
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,962
Someone breaks his moral code.

1257
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,128
Why are you telling me this?

1258
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,363
I'm retiring in a few months.

1259
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,844
When she calls,

1260
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:49,160
somebody needs to be there to answer.

1261
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,121
No.

1262
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,204
He's a criminal, Ray.

1263
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,481
Yeah.

1264
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:14,803
He aids and abets drug cartels,
money launderers.

1265
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,882
He's a fucking killer.

1266
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,406
Believe me,
I wrestled with the same decision.

1267
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,004
But when I got that first call,

1268
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,643
I realized something.

1269
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,530
I'd spent my whole life only recognizing
my lucky breaks after they were gone.

1270
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,245
The Brit, who is she?

1271
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,281
Hello?

1272
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,851
Miss Medina.

1273
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:07,005
Tell Eliot Ness to get his feet
off the furniture.

1274
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,049
He's not in a barn.

1275
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,206
Living Robotics.

1276
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,445
Write it down.

1277
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,320
North of six feet, short hair,
athletic build, yes?

1278
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,448
- Correct.
- But when you say short hair,

1279
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,722
you mean short hair like my hair,
or you mean short hair like...

1280
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,041
What's the difference?

1281
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,884
I was told you could fix this, so fix it!

1282
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,042
But you did speak to the man, am I right?
You spoke to him?

1283
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,601
What did he sound like?

1284
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:36,048
I didn't make small talk.
What's it matter what he sounded...

1285
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,882
That's Ike, right? That's the north side?

1286
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,562
Yo, Bobby, was that you?

1287
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,561
Bob.

1288
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,640
Bobby.

1289
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,401
Ike, are you there?

1290
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,161
Ike?

1291
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,240
Guys, stop fucking around.
Someone answer me. Ike?

1292
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,084
Pull was to the left.

1293
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:06,767
You might consider using a round
with a superior ballistic coefficient.

1294
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,444
Give me the layout of the home.

1295
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,843
Points of entry, corridors, rooms, cover.

1296
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,001
Go.

1297
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,250
Fuck.

1298
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,721
- Sit down.
- What's this...

1299
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,723
Shut up. Sit down in the chair.

1300
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:56,647
You ever see a match-grade round traveling
3,000 feet per second go through a window?

1301
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,081
Nobody does.

1302
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,401
Get down, now!

1303
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,683
Four men, front entrance.

1304
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,130
Go right at him. Go now.

1305
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,721
You...

1306
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:51,801
I got the cameras.

1307
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,604
Go join your friends.

1308
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,521
Up.

1309
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,481
Clear.

1310
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:17,761
Smoke.

1311
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:43,965
Go, go!

1312
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,206
Go, go!

1313
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,764
Attack front entry!

1314
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,411
Man down!

1315
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:08,971
Guys, talk to me.

1316
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,363
You got eyes on who it is?

1317
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,204
Someone talk to me.
Let me know what the sitrep is.

1318
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,040
Are they dead?

1319
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,327
Give me a situation report. How many down?

1320
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:49,731
Are they dead? Answer me!

1321
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,926
Okay, he's on the roof.
Start forming up. Let's move.

1322
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,770
Check skylights, check windows.

1323
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,001
That motherfucker comes in,

1324
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,640
I wanna hear gunshots
and I wanna hear "target eliminated."

1325
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,405
That's enough. He's in the goddamn house.

1326
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,446
Get out there and end this!

1327
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:18,206
Brax, give me a situation report.
Have you got eyes on anything?

1328
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,044
What's happening?

1329
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,131
Say something!

1330
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:51,009
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

1331
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:55,280
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

1332
01:46:56,160 --> 01:47:00,324
Sick on Thursday
Worse on Friday

1333
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:05,405
Died on Saturday
Buried on Sunday

1334
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:10,491
"And that was the end of Solomon Grundy"

1335
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:15,764
What is this?

1336
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,201
Hey! Hey!

1337
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:39,441
Stand down!

1338
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,687
Fuck off!

1339
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,089
Hello, Braxton.

1340
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,081
No, no.

1341
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,046
Don't...

1342
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:31,451
Don't do that...

1343
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,206
Been looking for you for 10 years,

1344
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,482
and you're gonna come at me
like we just saw each other yesterday?

1345
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:40,290
That's what you're gonna do?

1346
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:41,681
What did I...

1347
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,130
What'd I think?

1348
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:47,762
What'd I think? That you were gonna be
happy to see me, I guess.

1349
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,971
I am happy.

1350
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,044
I need to finish.

1351
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,281
You should go.

1352
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,885
I should go?

1353
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,446
Okay...

1354
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:07,930
Okay, I'll just go.

1355
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,087
But first, I'm gonna ask you a question.

1356
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,651
You're gonna give me an answer.

1357
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:15,770
Why would you and Pop go to that funeral?

1358
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,445
She left us. Do you not remember that?

1359
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:19,170
Do you not remember that?

1360
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,448
It's your fault that Pop's dead!
You hear me?

1361
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:30,601
It's your fault!

1362
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:32,569
- I'm sorry, Braxton.
- Sorry?

1363
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,643
Sorry doesn't cut it, you weird fuck!

1364
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,964
You don't give a shit about me?
You don't give a shit about me?

1365
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:08,645
How about now?

1366
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:10,926
How about now?

1367
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,129
Are you gonna fight?

1368
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,521
Fight!

1369
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,609
I'm sorry, Braxton.

1370
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,442
If you had to see her,

1371
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:27,011
if that was something that you had to do,

1372
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,285
you call me.

1373
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,890
I'm your brother.
I've always had your back.

1374
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:36,247
You don't call him, you call me.

1375
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,803
Did you even wonder where I was?

1376
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:46,610
I knew where you were.

1377
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,728
I just wanted you to be safe.

1378
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:53,651
Some of my clients are quite dangerous.

1379
01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:00,051
I'm, kind of, considered
fairly dangerous myself.

1380
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:03,724
Well, you've made improvements.

1381
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:13,925
Shit, man.

1382
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:16,809
You and me here...

1383
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,131
What are the odds?

1384
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,486
Statistically speaking...

1385
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:22,642
Christ, man! It's rhetorical.

1386
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:24,649
I mean, really?

1387
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,211
I was just saying.

1388
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,448
Not happy.

1389
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,287
Do you consider
what you do important, Mr. Wolff?

1390
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,761
To someone other than yourself, I mean?

1391
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:42,242
What I do is.

1392
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:46,850
Living Robotics' public offering
would've been worth billions.

1393
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,970
Money to be used
for neuroprosthetics, nanotechnology.

1394
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:51,167
You...

1395
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:55,487
Why in God's name did I ever hire you?

1396
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:57,483
To leak-proof your books.

1397
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,845
Dana found a mistake, and you wanted
to be sure it was safe to go public.

1398
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,124
And now you want to kill her.

1399
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,441
I'm fond of Dana.

1400
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:08,531
But I restore lives, not Dana! Me!

1401
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:12,730
Men, women, children,
I give them hope. Make them whole.

1402
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:14,450
Do you even know what that's like?

1403
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,880
Yes, I do.

1404
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,521
Sorry.

1405
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:36,890
I missed you.

1406
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:45,804
"Missed you, too, Braxton.

1407
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,243
"Missed you, too, because I love you.

1408
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,084
"You're my brother."

1409
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:56,920
Maybe...

1410
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,284
Do you want to...

1411
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:02,242
Maybe I could see you in a week?

1412
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,607
You name the place. I'll be there.

1413
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,364
How will I find you?

1414
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:22,965
You won't.

1415
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,204
I'll find you.

1416
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:32,321
There.

1417
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:35,450
How do you respond to rumors

1418
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:38,968
that some of the victims have wounds
consistent with anti-aircraft rounds?

1419
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:40,963
I'd say the Chicago Police Department

1420
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:44,124
has ample experience
solving all manner of homicides.

1421
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:47,647
Tom.

1422
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,808
Sir, how are the conspiracy
and fraud charges

1423
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:52,691
related to the deaths of Lamar Blackburn
and his sister, Rita?

1424
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:55,002
This is a very fluid situation

1425
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:59,127
with a lot of surprising revelations
over the last 48 hours.

1426
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:02,927
Let me introduce you to the person
leading the investigation...

1427
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,166
Agent Medina.

1428
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:16,687
Um...

1429
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,200
Good afternoon.

1430
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:24,929
As much as I'd like
to take credit for this,

1431
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,764
I can't.

1432
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,726
Because this was a team effort

1433
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:42,570
comprised of long hours
of good old-fashioned investigative work.

1434
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,721
Questions?

1435
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:53,564
He was just like our other two.
He was a happy baby.

1436
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:56,560
Now he rarely speaks.

1437
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,646
It's like our child is missing.
He's not there.

1438
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:02,201
He's lost, and he needs our help.

1439
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,885
We thought...

1440
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:07,891
We thought...

1441
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,725
We hoped that he would catch back up.

1442
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:12,880
But he didn't.

1443
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,122
One in 68 children in this country

1444
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:18,290
are diagnosed with a form of autism.

1445
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:19,965
But if you can put aside for a moment

1446
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:23,767
what your pediatrician and all
the other NTs have said about your son...

1447
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,251
What? NTs?

1448
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:27,609
Neurotypicals.

1449
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:29,450
The rest of us.

1450
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,324
What if we're wrong?

1451
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:35,002
What if we've been using the wrong tests

1452
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:38,482
to quantify intelligence
in children with autism?

1453
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:41,650
Your son's not less-than.

1454
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:44,610
He's different.

1455
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:49,325
Now, your expectations for your son
may change over time.

1456
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:53,923
They might include
marriage, children, self-sufficiency.

1457
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:55,650
And they might not.

1458
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:57,807
But I guarantee you,

1459
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:01,806
if we let the world set expectations
for our children, they'll start low...

1460
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,011
And they'll stay there.

1461
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,364
Maybe your son's capable of
much more than we know.

1462
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:13,770
And maybe,

1463
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,128
just maybe,

1464
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:17,964
he doesn't understand how to tell us.

1465
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,285
Or...

1466
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:24,886
We haven't yet learned how to listen.

1467
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,727
Honey, for the hundredth time,
don't wander off like that.

1468
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:56,527
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. It's fine.

1469
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:58,648
Can he visit with you
for a while, Justine?

1470
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,161
Okay, good. Come on, folks.
I'll give you the nickel tour.

1471
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,367
You okay with that?

1472
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:06,524
It's okay, hon. Come on.

1473
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:08,404
No, they'll be fine.

1474
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,361
Justine's one of
our few full-time residents.

1475
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:15,847
She stopped talking 30 years ago.

1476
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,526
Communicates with
a digital translator now.

1477
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,169
Doctor, how is Harbor funded?

1478
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,728
We're fortunate to have
very generous private donors.

1479
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,211
I'll say they're generous.

1480
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:27,600
Oh, why is that?

1481
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,524
That woman, Justine...

1482
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:31,921
- Yeah, my daughter.
- She's your daughter?

1483
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:34,361
The reason I started the institute.

1484
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:37,286
Justine's computer, it's a BX32.

1485
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,528
Water-cooled, 12 core.

1486
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:42,531
Oh, that's right.
You're a software engineer.

1487
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:46,446
Well, some of our donors
are more generous than others.

1488
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:48,608
Why? Is that a good computer?

1489
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,406
Good?

1490
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,645
Doc, she could backdoor
the Pentagon with that rig.

1491
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,406
Hello, dreamboat. Shall we chat?

1492
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,320
- Hi.
- Hi.

1493
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:28,766
Sign here, please.

1494
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,286
Thank you.

1495
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:36,560
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
