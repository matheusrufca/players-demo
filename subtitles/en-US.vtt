Hey, hey, hey!

00:41.400 --> 00:42.440
What the fuck?

00:44.200 --> 00:46.040
Wait! I gotta call it in!

00:49.000 --> 00:50.040
Move it!

00:59.040 --> 01:00.090
Hey!

01:01.680 --> 01:03.090
Bobby, you hear me?

01:09.840 --> 01:11.330
Right there, motherfucker!

01:28.520 --> 01:29.850
Please.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.840
Just fucking stop, man!

01:32.000 --> 01:33.530
Just put the gun down!

01:36.680 --> 01:38.810
Come on.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.010
Please.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.610
I'm fucking begging you.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.370
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

01:45.520 --> 01:46.600
I wasn't even...

02:12.040 --> 02:14.770
Worse on Friday
Died on Saturday

02:14.920 --> 02:16.050
Buried on Sunday

02:16.240 --> 02:18.970

02:25.880 --> 02:27.960
Justine, please.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.240
It's called "stimming," self-stimulation.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.920
Whereas you and I might tap our fingers,

02:38.080 --> 02:40.560
grind our teeth, bite our nails,

02:40.760 --> 02:42.490
your son rocks back and forth.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.450
It's more obvious, but perfectly natural.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.090
We came here because
we heard you specialized in...

02:49.240 --> 02:51.130
What is it? What does he have?

02:51.280 --> 02:53.930
I'm not a fan of labels, ma'am.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.290
Your son is a remarkable young man.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.210
Who goes crazy
when you turn the vacuum on.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.440
He wears one T-shirt,
won't let you hug him.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.440
Loud noises, bright lights

03:05.600 --> 03:08.920
can be especially difficult
for someone like your son.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.330
The shirt, most likely fabric sensitivity.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.610
Hugging, closeness, touching...

03:15.880 --> 03:16.880
Justine, no shoes today.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.530
That can be a challenge, yes.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.210
When it's somebody else's child,
it's a challenge.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.810
When it's yours, it's a problem.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.690
My practice focuses on education.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.320
I'd like to work with your son,
at his speed.

03:32.840 --> 03:36.210
Help him develop the skills
he'll need to lead a full life.

03:36.400 --> 03:40.240
Communicating, eye contact,
understanding non-verbal cues,

03:40.400 --> 03:41.850
making friends.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.810
The only friend he has
is his little brother.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.320
I'm sure moving from base to base
hasn't helped.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.010
My husband's in the Army,
which means we all are.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.160
Would you be willing to let your son
stay with us for the summer

03:57.320 --> 04:00.930
free of charge, working with me
in a sensory-friendly environment?

04:01.080 --> 04:02.730
That's not gonna happen.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.000
If loud noises and bright lights
bother him,

04:06.160 --> 04:08.560
he needs more of it, not less.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.370
The world is not a sensory-friendly place,

04:12.560 --> 04:14.690
and that's where
he needs to learn to live.

04:16.520 --> 04:17.760
Not in here.

04:18.520 --> 04:23.400
Doctor, in your opinion,
can our son lead a normal life?

04:24.200 --> 04:26.250
Define normal.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.520
I need to finish! I need to finish!

Hmm. Mmm.

05:26.840 --> 05:31.080
I, uh... I never thought of myself as
a quitter... Fourth-generation farmer.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.640
But between the property taxes

05:37.320 --> 05:39.770
and the fertilizer costs, and insurance...

05:44.960 --> 05:46.090
Oh, to hell with it.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.650
What if, just temporarily, mind you,

05:48.800 --> 05:51.640
we put this year's taxes
on our credit card?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.370
Do you like it?

05:59.520 --> 06:00.890
I made it myself.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.610
No, not particularly.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.970
But do you ever sell them?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.610
At church fairs now and again.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.720
Mrs. Rice, you may have what the IRS
calls a "home-based business."

06:09.880 --> 06:12.010
What room do you use in your house
when you make those?

06:12.160 --> 06:13.210
I don't, really.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.010
Just wherever I happen to be, I guess.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.640
In front of the TV, at the kitchen table.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.040
I like to spread my beads out
in the dining room, but Frank gets...

06:20.200 --> 06:22.490
Yes, it would be better
if you could try to remember

06:22.640 --> 06:24.960
the one specific space that you use.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.330
Your home is 2,913 square feet.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.490
IRS code allows us to deduct
from your taxable income

06:30.640 --> 06:33.330
a percentage of your workspace
relative to your overall home.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.560
- What...
- Mr. Rice...

06:34.960 --> 06:36.530
How big is your dining room?

06:37.160 --> 06:38.400
Mrs. Rice's office.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.770
I wouldn't so much as call it an office...

06:40.960 --> 06:42.120
Oh.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.410
It's, uh, approximately 200, uh...

06:51.880 --> 06:54.010
Well, make it 300 square feet.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.690
Excellent. Mrs. Rice...

06:55.840 --> 06:56.920
Dolores.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.450
Dolores, when you order supplies,
do you order online?

07:00.600 --> 07:03.000
I don't. I just zip on over
to the bead store.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.400
Zip?

07:04.680 --> 07:07.160
I drive the truck.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.570
The company truck.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.360
Come in.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.280
Mr. King, you have wandered
so far outside your legal purview.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.010
As president of Southern Gulf Bank,

07:37.160 --> 07:39.730
I intend to protect
my customers' privacy...

07:39.880 --> 07:40.930
Stop talking.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.400
You have a very cavalier attitude
for the president of a bank,

07:43.560 --> 07:44.930
with such a piss-poor capital cushion.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.730
Now, I want a record of every transaction
Abayed has had for the past two years.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.570
Deposits, withdrawals,
cashier's checks, credit cards.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.880
Birmingham or Bahrain,
it is now Treasury business.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.410
Goodbye.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.090
Medina.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.610
Am I saying that correctly?

07:59.760 --> 08:00.890
Medina, yes, sir.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.250
I've read all your case files,
Director King.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.090
It's impressive work. Very.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.400
Marybeth Ascension Medina.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.930
Graduated University of Baltimore
cum laude

08:13.080 --> 08:15.130
with a degree in criminal justice.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.840
Two years Baltimore PD as an analyst,
two more at Homeland, analyst again,

08:20.240 --> 08:23.800
and the last five years here at Treasury.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.170
Analyst.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.690
You did the heavy lifting
on Agent Lorenz's case last month.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.440
I worked on it, yeah, but Agent Lorenz...

08:32.600 --> 08:35.290
Why haven't you applied
for promotion to agent?

08:35.760 --> 08:37.290
You're already doing the work.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.930
Analyst is a good fit.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.120
And I enjoy the work, so...

08:44.680 --> 08:47.680
Well, you're a liar, Medina.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.410
Ward of the state of Maryland's

08:52.560 --> 08:54.850
foster care and juvenile detention systems

08:55.000 --> 08:57.130
from age 11 to 18.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.280
Weapons charges, assault and battery.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.200
Ouch.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.200
Attempted murder.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.570
Those records were sealed.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.560
Is that a nine millimeter?

09:15.560 --> 09:16.640
.45.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.170
You better sit your ass
back down in that chair, young lady.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.160
This is a big moment for you.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.250
Make a good choice.

09:36.320 --> 09:41.330
Lying on a federal employment application
is a felony.

09:43.240 --> 09:49.010
So right now, I'm the only thing standing
between you and significant prison time.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.170
What do you want?

09:54.920 --> 09:58.000
Do you like puzzles, Marybeth Medina?

10:01.280 --> 10:04.520
I meant what I said, son.
You're welcome out to the place anytime.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.330
Do you fish? I got a two-acre pond

10:06.480 --> 10:07.850
that is just thick with catfish and bass...

10:08.040 --> 10:10.360
I don't fish. I shoot.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.210
Well, the farm's a perfect place
to do a little plinkin', so...

10:15.040 --> 10:16.040
Well...

10:16.920 --> 10:18.080
Thank you.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.720
You take care, son.

10:20.880 --> 10:21.960
Thank you.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.480
My daughter's meeting me for lunch.
I think you two just might hit it off.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.050
Nice to see you.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.800
Already enhanced.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.250
Was taken three years ago in Antwerp
by an undercover Interpol agent.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.290
Their target's on the far right.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.890
Yeah, Zalmay Atta.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.650
Go on.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.730
Ran the world's largest opium pipeline.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.410
Ties to Karzai and Ghani, Taliban.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.010
I mean, he was considered untouchable.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.400
Look at the rest. Tell me what you see.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.920
Yeah, I remember most of these arrests.
They were huge.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.240
Focus. They're not all arrests.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.770
It's the same man.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.370
"Lou Carroll."

11:27.080 --> 11:28.920
For what it's worth, it's an alias.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.200
The Hong Kong photo
goes back about five years.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.970
In that one, he's "Carl Gauss."

11:35.080 --> 11:39.450
Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Naples.
There was a sighting in Tehran.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.520
All describing the same man.
"An accountant."

11:41.720 --> 11:44.120
"Our accountant." "The accountant."

11:44.280 --> 11:47.410
The accountant, like CPA accountant?

11:49.360 --> 11:50.490
Okay.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.650
Say you're the head of the Sinaloa Cartel.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.370
Now, the cartels count their money

11:56.520 --> 11:58.680
by weighing it in 18-wheelers.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.130
But one sunny Mexican day,

12:01.320 --> 12:04.960
your in-house money scrubber comes to you
and says you're 30 million light.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.400
Who can you trust to do
the forensic accounting,

12:07.560 --> 12:09.320
track your stolen cash?

12:09.480 --> 12:11.690
Deloitte and Touche? H&R Block?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.640
You somehow

12:14.800 --> 12:17.690
contact an individual
capable of coming in cold,

12:17.880 --> 12:20.170
un-cooking years of books,

12:20.840 --> 12:22.840
and getting out alive.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.810
I retire in seven months.

12:24.960 --> 12:29.680
Before I do, I need to know
who he is, how he does it.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.410
I mean, who survives
this kind of clientele?

12:32.600 --> 12:34.600
The secrets this guy has.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.410
What exactly do you want me to do?

12:40.280 --> 12:42.170
Report directly to me.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.850
No other case work.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.370
No other Treasury personnel involved.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.130
At the end of the month,
one of two things will have occurred.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.040
Resolution of this case,

12:56.120 --> 12:58.410
or we update your photo.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.800
You want it your way? You got it!

14:46.320 --> 14:47.970
Mom! Mom! Mom!

14:48.120 --> 14:50.330
Mom! Why is Mom leaving? Mom!

14:50.560 --> 14:52.290
Mom! Mom!

14:53.720 --> 14:55.640
- I just got home.
- You're always...

15:05.720 --> 15:06.720
Mom! Why are you leaving?

15:06.960 --> 15:08.010
I'm just asking you to stay.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.320
- Just, please stay.
- We had help!

15:09.480 --> 15:11.370
- Stay here! Don't go anywhere!
- You threw it away!

15:16.440 --> 15:17.570
No. Hey.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.360
That's it.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.600
Please don't leave...

15:26.080 --> 15:27.450
Mom!

15:27.760 --> 15:28.920
Here we go, here we go.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.680
Here we go.

- That was the end of Solomon Grundy

Do it again.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.250
Looks like somebody's seen
too many westerns.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.970
Yeah, must be what...

16:44.760 --> 16:46.130
A mile out?

16:48.440 --> 16:50.360
Not on my best day...

17:04.400 --> 17:05.770
Holy shit.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.770
Okay, listen to me.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.810
In-flec-tion. Right?
Listen, just listen to my tone.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.800
I say, "Oh, I'm another year older,

18:47.960 --> 18:51.570
"and I don't know if I'm ever gonna
get out of this fucking place."

18:51.720 --> 18:53.210
And you say...

18:53.400 --> 18:55.050
You're probably right, Francis.
You're extremely old.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.570
- It's unlikely you'll survive to...
- No. No...

18:56.720 --> 18:58.880
No. Hold on. That's not what you say.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.050
Two years together every night, you know.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.290
I gave you a PhD in black money,
but you gotta learn this.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.170
- This is crucial.
- You're frustrated.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.560
- What am I?
- You're frustrated.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.720
That's what I am.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.490
I'm frustrated. Good, good. Excellent.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.970
Finally. All right. Let's do another one.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.770
Lights out, ladies. Lights out.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.570
Names and addresses. Go.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.010
Semion Ivankov.
79 Primorsky Boulevard, Odessa.

19:27.160 --> 19:31.770
The Meier brothers, Moshe and Itzhak.
221 She'arim Boulevard in Jerusalem.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.690
Dominic Rabito of
960 Court Street, Brooklyn.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.080
Ask for Bobby.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.480
Ask for Bobby.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.850
You know, I'm old.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.290
I may be remembering things
a little rosier than they were.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.530
I mean, you want to fill out 1040s
and itemize deductions,

19:46.680 --> 19:48.760
and pull in 50 grand a year?
I mean, that's a living.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.690
Because if you go down
this road, this road...

19:51.840 --> 19:55.370
You can't go back, you understand?
It's dangerous. Do you understand?

19:55.520 --> 19:56.600
I understand.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.450
You find one person
you can trust, just one.

19:59.600 --> 20:03.490
And do not make my mistake.
You keep moving your ass around.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.200
They gave me a new handler today.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.800
I don't like this guy. He's dull.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.800
Worried.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.330
Ah, fuck it.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.360
Good night, son.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.400
Good night, Francis.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.560
What about Zurich? Saudi Arabia?

20:43.760 --> 20:44.970
The Swiss are cheap.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.490
Dubai is one thing, but we're
too conspicuous in the Kingdom.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.730
I vote Chicago.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.880
- Why?
- There's an uptick in online chatter.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.200
People looking for you.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.520
- What people?
- The unfriendly kind.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.010
Let's try a legitimate client for once.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.930
No cartels, arms brokers,
money launderers, assassins.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.930
I like safe. I like you safe.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.530
Everyone's hiding something.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.440
At least there's honor among thieves.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.760
There's honor among Illinois
electronics manufacturers.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.690
They're in your current backyard.
No risk of movement. You'll meet?

21:17.640 --> 21:18.720
Yeah, I'll meet.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.930
One last piece of business.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.240
Just the Renoir.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.970
I don't have a buyer for the Renoir.

21:24.280 --> 21:27.360
The Pollock can move.
Will you ever let it go?

21:29.760 --> 21:30.760
Hello?

21:30.920 --> 21:33.370
Just the Renoir. Drop the price.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.250
Heavy sigh.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.280
Go to work, dreamboat.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.760
Now, Mr. Wolff, I half-suspect
we're wasting your time.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.450
I'm quite sure you're not.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.130
And you know this how?

21:54.280 --> 21:55.880
I'm on the clock.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.080
Shit.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.080
I hope we're not wasting ours then.

22:01.400 --> 22:05.410
Look, kidding aside, I think if you
saw our books, you'd run for the hills.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.290
We have an incredibly complicated
accounting system.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.920
Depreciation schedules
on hundreds of different items.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.970
Full-time and contract employees.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.120
Department of Defense classified accounts.

22:16.280 --> 22:17.440
It's a numerical shitstorm.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.440
I'll need to see all those books
for the past 10 years.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.250
Bank statements, complete list
of clients and vendors.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.360
Hard copies printed out, my eyes only.
All the information's right here.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.840
Okay, well, well, look.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.840
This all came to my attention
only last week.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.970
Now, a junior cost accountant
stuck her nose where it didn't belong,

22:34.160 --> 22:36.160
and obviously had no idea
what she was looking at.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.600
Lamar's overreacting.
There's no missing money.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.130
How long have you been CFO
of this company, sir?

22:41.280 --> 22:42.360
15 years.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.570
I need the books for the past 15, please.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.120
Well, you're awful goddamn blunt!

22:47.280 --> 22:49.810
I'm Lamar Blackburn's oldest friend.

22:49.960 --> 22:50.960
I've been by his side

22:51.120 --> 22:54.440
since he was turning out RC robots
that RadioShack called crap.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.120
I wouldn't take a dime without his say-so.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.040
You're angry.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.530
Oh, this is bullshit.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.320
Unusual way of making contact
with you, Mr. Wolff.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.960
You were recommended by Mansoor Haqqani.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.520
We custom-made prosthetics
for his youngest daughter.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.920
You may know that she lost both legs

23:13.120 --> 23:15.650
to a car bomb
outside his investment firm in Lahore.

23:16.560 --> 23:20.490
He told my brother, Lamar, that you were
nothing short of supernatural.

23:22.080 --> 23:26.050
Mr. Haqqani holds advanced degrees
in mathematics from Cambridge

23:26.200 --> 23:28.040
and Caltech.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.000
Why does a man like that need you?

23:32.080 --> 23:34.370
I don't discuss client business.

25:05.520 --> 25:08.520
What do you suppose that young man
is thinking right now?

25:09.760 --> 25:11.760
"Why do I still feel my arm?"

25:11.920 --> 25:13.160
I don't know.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.680
"How did everything go so wrong, so fast?"

25:17.520 --> 25:20.210
"It's cold. Turn up the heat."

25:22.320 --> 25:23.610
Christian Wolff, I presume.

25:23.760 --> 25:24.760
Mr. Blackburn.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.200
Lamar.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.800
Lamar.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.280
Come with me.

25:33.440 --> 25:37.130
Are you aware of Living Robotics'
three income streams?

25:37.280 --> 25:39.600
Consumer electronics,
next generation prosthetics,

25:39.760 --> 25:41.290
unmanned military applications.

25:41.480 --> 25:44.370
Prosthetics division showed tremendous
growth over the last 10 years.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.890
It seems to have matured.

25:46.040 --> 25:49.680
Consumer products is your highest source
of revenue, followed closely

25:49.840 --> 25:52.730
by Defense Department contracts
and prosthetics at two and three.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.800
Yeah. You are well-informed.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.400
I never married.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.050
Never had kids.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.330
This company is my child.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.170
That said, money has never
been a motivation.

26:08.320 --> 26:12.010
Balance sheets,
profit and loss statements...

26:12.840 --> 26:15.320
My mind doesn't function
the way yours must.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.040
I need you to be my eyes and ears, Chris.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.970
Whatever you need to do your job,
you let me know.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.840
I'll start in the morning.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.200
Son of a bitch.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.290
Bloody hell.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.920
Excuse me...

27:03.280 --> 27:05.570
Who the fuck do you think you are?

27:05.720 --> 27:07.560
Do you know who the fuck I am?

27:08.200 --> 27:09.730
Simon Dewey.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.560
Founder, CEO, Dewey Capital.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.970
American. Shocking.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.050
I have kidnap insurance.
You obviously know that.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.890
Sorry, but how in the world
would I know that you have...

27:22.040 --> 27:23.570
You people fucking amaze me...

27:25.240 --> 27:28.160
When you interrupt somebody like that,
it makes them feel

27:28.320 --> 27:31.090
that you're just not interested
in what they have to say.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.920
Or maybe you just think
what you have to say

27:33.080 --> 27:35.080
is more important than what I have to say.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.970
Is that what you think?

27:39.400 --> 27:42.880
That gun makes you a big man, does it?

27:44.240 --> 27:46.810
This gun? Simon, come on.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.130
I'm part of a small but potent department
of a private security force.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.650
We have a client, let's call it
a European manufacturing concern.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.280
You're shorting their stock,
but simultaneously,

27:59.440 --> 28:02.130
you're spreading false rumors
regarding the health of the company.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.960
The resulting decline in the stock price,
it's made you your millions,

28:06.160 --> 28:07.920
but it's been at my client's expense.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.490
They have been forced
to cut hundreds of jobs, Simon.

28:10.640 --> 28:14.120
These are third-generation metal workers,
people with families.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.850
Pensions are being rendered worthless
because of you.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.970
But you'll stop now. Correct?

28:20.960 --> 28:21.960
Which company?

28:22.320 --> 28:23.480
Wrong answer, Simon.

28:23.680 --> 28:24.810
Look, genius...

28:26.520 --> 28:27.600
That's the same spot, Simon.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.130
Why you gonna let me hit you
in the same exact spot?

28:30.280 --> 28:31.410
I only meant

28:31.800 --> 28:33.800
we hold short positions
on dozens of companies.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.120
Shit, son.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.880
I suppose

28:37.040 --> 28:39.730
you're spreading false information
about more than one company.

28:39.880 --> 28:43.770
If that's what you're doing, you're just
gonna have to stop shorting them all.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.650
That's ridiculous.
I can't be expected to...

28:48.680 --> 28:50.410
Ooh, I know.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.050
All right, get your chin up, Simon.
No pouting on my watch.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.170
Yeah, you're a man. You just...

28:57.320 --> 28:58.770
You're a man in your own way.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.640
All right.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.650
I'm an avid reader of the Journal.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.170
So, I expect the cooperation
to be reflected there.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.160
Simon?

29:16.520 --> 29:17.760
Are we good?

29:18.240 --> 29:19.240
Yeah?

29:22.080 --> 29:24.240
Attaboy, Simon. Proud of you.

30:12.960 --> 30:13.960
Oh, hello.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.450
Good morning. Oh, shit... Hi.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.130
- Hi.
- Um, um...

30:19.920 --> 30:22.650
I'm Dana Cummings.
You're the consultant? Mr. Wolff?

30:22.840 --> 30:25.650
- Chris.
- Hi, Chris, then.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.970
I'm Dana.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.410
Cummings.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.810
Yes. Um...

30:31.400 --> 30:33.480
These are all the files you wanted.

30:33.680 --> 30:37.530
I cross-referenced them
by year, and alphabetically, so...

30:38.160 --> 30:39.610
It must have taken you all night.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.250
It sure did.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.480
Hmm.

30:43.760 --> 30:44.760
Right.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.520
So...

30:51.000 --> 30:52.160
So...

30:55.920 --> 30:57.840
What do you want, Dana Cummings?

30:58.720 --> 31:01.370
Oh, Mr. Blackburn, um...

31:02.360 --> 31:03.960
Sorry, he said I should...

31:04.320 --> 31:07.290
I'm the person
who first noticed the missing...

31:07.440 --> 31:10.440
- What I think was the missing money.
- Yes, I understand. I'll find it.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.970
Yeah. I thought we could... Have lunch...

31:15.280 --> 31:16.650
I brought my own lunch.

31:16.800 --> 31:17.960
No...

31:18.360 --> 31:19.650
I bring my own lunch, too.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.960
I can answer
any questions that you have...

31:22.120 --> 31:24.200
I have no questions.

31:25.120 --> 31:29.440
Yeah, okay. Yeah, you wanna
make your own assessment.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.810
Yes, thank you.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.120
Okay. Um...

31:34.960 --> 31:37.490
I'm in accounting if you need anything.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.170
There's, uh,

31:39.320 --> 31:41.160
some donuts there for you.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.160
I don't eat donuts.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Okay.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.160
Mr. Secretary!

31:53.320 --> 31:54.320
Yes, Helen.

31:54.480 --> 31:59.120
Sir, there's been speculation that your
ability to link banks in South Florida

31:59.280 --> 32:01.170
to money laundering efforts of terrorists

32:01.320 --> 32:04.400
are actually the result of
a whistleblower or the NSA.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.560
Care to comment?

32:06.000 --> 32:07.840
Let me turn this over
to the head of my task force,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.650
Financial Crimes Director, Raymond King.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.890
Folks, there's no great mystery here.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.690
Nothing fancy. Just team effort,

32:21.840 --> 32:25.890
comprised of long hours of
good old-fashioned investigative work.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.520
Questions?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.600
Could you answer
the whistleblower question?

32:31.800 --> 32:33.040
No.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.730
Hey, Sorkis, give me something.

32:36.880 --> 32:40.890
I matched the face in your Antwerp photo
to surveillance video in NYPD database.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.880
Wait, wait, wait. NYPD? What did you find?

32:45.200 --> 32:48.490
2006. Your guy takes out two mob enforcers

32:48.640 --> 32:52.090
with a steak knife he lifted off
an Italian restaurant down the street.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.770
Then he strolls into
a den of stone-cold killers

32:54.920 --> 32:56.810
and goes on a seven-man killing spree,

32:56.960 --> 32:58.410
using their own weapons.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.810
Headshot, headshot, headshot.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.080
Sorkis, stop.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.560
A den of stone-cold killers? Where is this?

33:06.720 --> 33:09.560
The Ravenite. Headquarters
of the Gambino crime family.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.090
He killed Anthony "Little Tony" Bazzano.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.290
Forensics lists cause of death
as blunt force trauma.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.250
Your boy kicked him in the head once.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.240
Again. Play it again.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.160
Hey, hey, hey!

33:23.400 --> 33:25.640
What the fuck?

33:26.560 --> 33:28.690
Wait! I gotta call it in!

33:30.520 --> 33:32.360
I've also got an audio file here.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.440
Inside of the Ravenite was bugged.

33:35.840 --> 33:36.840
Come on.

33:38.680 --> 33:39.680
Please.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.330
That's Little Tony.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.930
I'm fucking begging you.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.650
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

33:45.800 --> 33:47.010
Okay, get me that recording ASAP.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.370
I wasn't even...

33:50.640 --> 33:51.640
M.B.,

33:52.120 --> 33:54.120
you're an analyst for Treasury.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.840
What the hell have you got yourself into?

34:25.160 --> 34:27.810
What do you have to hit
to dent a steel thermos?

34:30.080 --> 34:31.490
It's just old.

34:36.840 --> 34:40.080
How did you, um,
get into financial consulting?

34:40.240 --> 34:43.130
Department of Labor statistics indicate

34:43.280 --> 34:45.410
it's one of
the fastest-growing professions.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.920
Actuarial sciences are experiencing
tremendous growth as well.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.530
Okay.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.770
I like the balance of it.

34:58.920 --> 35:02.690
You know, I like finding things
that aren't obvious.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.520
Plus, my dad was an accountant.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.520
He actually...

35:10.680 --> 35:13.730
You know, he had the whole shtick.
The, uh...

35:15.120 --> 35:18.520
You know, the little amortization book,
and the green eyeshade,

35:18.720 --> 35:20.770
and the, like,
dorky pocket protector and...

35:20.920 --> 35:22.570
I have a pocket protector.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.650
That's a nice one.
I mean, his was dorky, that's...

35:28.800 --> 35:30.250
Yours is nice.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.440
Um, but he convinced me
to go into the field.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.970
Because I wanted to study art
at the Art Institute of Chicago,

35:37.760 --> 35:39.760
but art doesn't pay the mortgage.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.050
"Art doesn't pay the mortgage,
young lady."

35:43.880 --> 35:46.410
Dad's tastes ran more to
Dogs Playing Poker.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.050
I like Dogs Playing Poker.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.240
Because dogs would never bet on things,

35:51.400 --> 35:53.480
and so, it's incongruous.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.920
I like incongruity.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.770
Yeah, Dogs Playing Poker is nice.
It's just sort of a...

36:05.960 --> 36:07.610
Just different.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.560
So, I studied accounting
at the University of Chicago,

36:10.720 --> 36:11.770
where fun goes to die.

36:11.920 --> 36:12.920
Why?

36:14.680 --> 36:15.920
Why what?

36:16.240 --> 36:19.160
Why does fun go to die
at the University of Chicago?

36:19.920 --> 36:21.840
Oh, no, it's just an expression.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.800
I'm joking.

36:30.840 --> 36:31.840
Right.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.240
- Um, I'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.800
Let me know if you need anything
while you're here.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.280
Have a nice day.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.930
Yes. You, too.

37:14.840 --> 37:19.970
Explain the 376, 109...
6,500,000... 6,008,000...

37:41.640 --> 37:43.210
Accounts receivable,
earnings before interest...

37:43.400 --> 37:45.210
Tax, depreciation,
administrative expenses...

37:55.120 --> 37:56.360
100, 644,000...

38:01.600 --> 38:04.810
Hydraulic sync systems,
aluminum bar supplies,

38:04.960 --> 38:06.800
techmod fitting, stable joints...

38:46.040 --> 38:47.250
Please.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.250
I'm fucking begging you.

38:49.400 --> 38:52.210
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

38:52.360 --> 38:53.570
I wasn't even...

39:01.800 --> 39:03.290
Okay.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.410
Give me something.

39:11.520 --> 39:12.520
Please.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.650
...fucking begging you.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.120
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

39:17.880 --> 39:19.040
I wasn't even...

39:28.280 --> 39:30.200
Come on, come on, come on.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.240
...begging you.

39:36.480 --> 39:39.480
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

40:09.040 --> 40:10.450
Born on a Monday

40:10.800 --> 40:13.720
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

40:13.880 --> 40:15.010
Solomon Grundy

40:15.680 --> 40:17.050
Born on Monday

40:17.360 --> 40:20.360
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

40:20.560 --> 40:21.850
Solomon Grundy

40:35.320 --> 40:38.010
Come in! Come in, come in, come in.
You have to see this. Look at this.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.120
It's gonna blow you away.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.520
I mean, it'll just jump right out at you.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.650
There it is.

40:46.960 --> 40:47.960
Uh-huh.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.650
Living Robotics, 10 years ago.

40:49.840 --> 40:50.970
Earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.930
$14,495,719.

40:54.080 --> 40:55.160
Nine years ago,

40:55.720 --> 40:58.370
earnings before tax and depreciation...

40:59.080 --> 41:01.240
Revenues go up, profits go down.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.650
Down? No large capital expenditures
dragging profits down.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.120
No spike in raw materials or labor costs.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.570
Year eight,
profits and revenue both go up,

41:09.720 --> 41:11.210
but not in a commensurate fashion.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.560
X no longer equals Y.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.610
Six, five, four, three.
You're making money.

41:15.760 --> 41:16.760
But there's a leak.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.810
And the leak is...

41:19.360 --> 41:21.200
Leak, where's the leak? Here.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.760
Slewitt Manufacturing.
I've signed these checks.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.410
- Who authorized it?
- Ed.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.330
Mr. Chilton. They make electronic
assemblies for the consumer division.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.960
No, they don't. Look at this.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.720
You notice anything?

41:38.480 --> 41:40.130
- Second number in each is a three.
- Yes.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.200
Most people,
when generating random numbers

41:43.360 --> 41:44.810
tend to rely subconsciously

41:44.960 --> 41:46.090
- on certain patterns.
- Patterns, yeah.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.240
Yes.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.570
- I was right!
- You were right.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.160
Yeah.

41:52.280 --> 41:56.290
I went through these ledgers for months,
and I got through one fiscal year.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.040
You went through 15 overnight?

41:58.240 --> 41:59.290
That's not even the best part, look.

41:59.720 --> 42:03.090
The best part is, they're routing money
to a company that doesn't exist.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.240
And yet, profits go up.
And they continue going up.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.610
Absolutely makes no sense.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.810
- Where's the money coming from?
- Exactly!

42:10.320 --> 42:11.610
Um, it's not inventory?

42:11.760 --> 42:12.920
Inventory turns. No.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.240
- Chargebacks to vendors?
- No. Perfectly in order.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.770
- Internal offsets?
- No. That's a terrible idea.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.570
Um...

42:26.400 --> 42:29.240
Cummings, you're needed in

42:29.440 --> 42:31.600
whatever area I'm paying you
to be needed in.

42:31.760 --> 42:32.760
Sorry.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.650
And?

42:56.640 --> 43:00.440
$61,679,000.

43:01.320 --> 43:02.650
And some change.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.770
Who did it? Best guess.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.520
I don't guess.

43:09.360 --> 43:11.680
You'll have a report for me?

43:11.960 --> 43:13.850
When I'm finished, yes.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.330
- Hey, Ed.
- What the...

43:50.040 --> 43:51.880
We're having lemon merengue pie.

43:52.040 --> 43:54.090
Those two bottles of insulin.

43:56.680 --> 43:59.370
You know, I just thought

43:59.680 --> 44:03.050
that you would appreciate me
treating you like an adult, right?

44:03.240 --> 44:04.920
So, here's what I got.

44:10.240 --> 44:15.200
You administer your own accidental
insulin overdose, and just...

44:16.320 --> 44:17.400
Die.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.010
But do it with dignity.

44:19.240 --> 44:23.930
Your wife, who's sleeping upstairs,
she'll be the beneficiary

44:24.080 --> 44:28.050
of what's gotta be a very generous
insurance policy, am I right?

44:28.200 --> 44:30.490
But the only way she's gonna
collect on that policy, Ed,

44:30.640 --> 44:33.250
is if we have the appearance
of an accident.

44:33.440 --> 44:37.210
If we lay our hands on you,
you're gonna fight, squeal.

44:37.400 --> 44:39.050
She wakes up, my hands are tied.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.440
One accidental death is just that,
but two, no.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.600
I'll have no choice.

44:43.760 --> 44:46.530
I'll have to rock and roll
a home invasion,

44:46.680 --> 44:48.440
violate your wife a dozen different ways,

44:48.600 --> 44:50.840
kill you both,
burn the place to the ground.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.330
I'm sorry for that. Ed, Ed, Ed?

44:55.480 --> 44:58.960
Hey, nobody's gonna
violate your wife, okay?

44:59.440 --> 45:02.920
Aside from what that would say
about me as a human being,

45:03.520 --> 45:05.570
physiologically it's a non-starter.

45:05.760 --> 45:09.890
Sometimes I think I just say shit,
sample what comes out of my mouth.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.850
I will, however,
park a .45 in her brainpan.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.250
I honor my commitments.

45:17.840 --> 45:22.450
It's a concept you and your sticky fingers
probably find hard to grasp.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.320
Make a decision, sir.

45:40.880 --> 45:43.170
Where are you going? Sir?

45:43.920 --> 45:45.000
Sir?

45:47.120 --> 45:49.090
Stop that. Why are you doing that?
Stop that.

45:49.240 --> 45:52.080
Sir? Sir? What are you doing? Excuse me?

45:52.240 --> 45:53.890
Mr. Chilton passed away.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.450
I was told to clean up the room.

45:57.480 --> 45:58.640
What's happening?

46:00.920 --> 46:02.810
Can you give us a minute, please?

46:05.920 --> 46:07.520
This is the balance of your contract.

46:07.720 --> 46:09.530
- I understand you're upset...
- Yes, I'm upset.

46:09.680 --> 46:10.680
I haven't finished yet.

46:10.840 --> 46:12.130
Yes, you have.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.490
Ed was a diabetic for 30 years.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.770
You think he didn't know
how to check his blood sugar?

46:17.080 --> 46:20.000
Whatever unresolved issues remain,

46:20.160 --> 46:23.450
my friend was poisoned enough by them
to take his own life.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.520
As far as I'm concerned,
whatever he did is forgiven.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.090
Please. I need to finish, please.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.530
- Sorry, I'll come back.
- No, no, come in, dear.

46:32.680 --> 46:34.050
We're done.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.090
You're very good, Mr. Wolff.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.810
But I hope our paths never cross again.

46:41.480 --> 46:44.320
I'm responsible
for the death of my best friend.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.770
I'd prefer not to be reminded of it.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.290
Do you think that's true?

47:02.160 --> 47:04.130
That Mr. Chilton killed himself...

47:04.840 --> 47:06.890
I mean, do you think we're responsible?

47:07.440 --> 47:10.280
It's very hard for me to interpret
why people do what they do.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.400
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished with this.

47:18.840 --> 47:21.000
I mean, look... Look at this.

47:22.520 --> 47:24.810
See, cost reports. This is out of order.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.960
They completely rearranged this.
I don't...

47:28.480 --> 47:30.530
I'm not finished. I'm not finished...

47:35.800 --> 47:37.040
Bye, Chris.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.810
No! Mom! Mom!

49:05.000 --> 49:07.840
Mom! Mom! Mom!

49:09.640 --> 49:11.560
Why is Mom leaving?

49:11.960 --> 49:13.200
Mom!

49:54.600 --> 49:55.600
Again.

50:17.720 --> 50:18.770
Again.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.160
Enough.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.600
They're not done.

50:49.040 --> 50:52.410
Tomorrow is another day.
They have done their best.

50:53.200 --> 50:56.840
If that were true, you'd be covered
in blood and snot, not them.

50:57.960 --> 50:59.330
Keep going.

51:11.800 --> 51:15.810
Aggression, correctly channeled,
overcomes a lot of flaws.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.120
Tapping into that aggression requires

51:20.960 --> 51:23.880
peeling back several layers of yourself.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.810
It's my job to know my sons' limitations.

51:29.640 --> 51:30.850
Get up.

51:32.800 --> 51:34.130
It's your job to peel.

51:34.560 --> 51:36.610
Do your job. On your feet.

51:54.480 --> 51:55.640
Again!

52:03.360 --> 52:06.730
We could have went to his house,
shot him in his home.

52:06.880 --> 52:08.560
And we'd be on a plane by now.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.960
Or on a security camera,
or some nosy neighbor's iPhone.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.370
Call the bookkeeper in.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.370
He's just too far. He won't hear...

52:20.520 --> 52:21.650
Now.

52:21.800 --> 52:24.530
Let's go. Get up. Come on.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.330
Move!

52:30.640 --> 52:32.010
Come on, come on, come on.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.370
Christian!

52:43.120 --> 52:44.120
Chris!

52:48.280 --> 52:50.360
Again! Louder!

52:54.080 --> 52:55.080
Up! Up!

53:00.640 --> 53:02.290
- No, no! Please!
- What the fuck?

53:02.440 --> 53:03.440
Dolores!

53:06.160 --> 53:07.210
She's coming with me.

53:07.360 --> 53:08.730
No, no, stop! Stop! Leave her...

53:15.080 --> 53:17.530
We're all going together.
Pull that truck around back.

53:17.680 --> 53:19.410
Let's go! Let's go!

53:23.240 --> 53:24.240
Let's move!

53:25.760 --> 53:27.970
Come on! Drive! Drive now!

53:38.440 --> 53:39.770
Jesus fucking Christ!

53:44.920 --> 53:46.080
God damn it!

53:49.640 --> 53:50.850
Son of a bitch!

54:30.120 --> 54:31.360
What the fuck?

54:44.760 --> 54:47.530
When I say the name of your employer,
you say "yes."

54:47.720 --> 54:48.720
Practice.

54:49.840 --> 54:50.890
Yes.

54:51.880 --> 54:52.880
Camorra.

54:53.560 --> 54:54.560
Ju\E1rez.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.210
Gambino.

54:57.080 --> 54:58.290
Do you understand the rules?

54:58.480 --> 55:00.850
My left pocket.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.920
They paid to

55:04.640 --> 55:05.850
kill you both.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.160
That's all I know.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.680
- Hello, dreamboat.
- Dana's in danger.

55:31.840 --> 55:34.410
Kill Christian Wolff,
transfer all domestic accounts overseas.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.600
- Current vehicle?
- F-150.

55:37.320 --> 55:39.480
- Virus to triple Z?
- Wipe everything.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.610
Done. In the DOT database now.

55:43.880 --> 55:45.690
Reassigning the license and VIN.

55:45.840 --> 55:48.370
I have George Boole
or Charles Babbage in the queue.

55:48.520 --> 55:50.280
Boole. Obviously.

55:50.440 --> 55:52.040
Silly of me. What else?

55:53.960 --> 55:55.330
She is not your problem.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.930
Straight to the trailer,
hook it up, and disappear.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.360
There's no time.

55:59.520 --> 56:00.850
Only the trailer.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.570
Address and phone number. Get it.

56:35.840 --> 56:37.130
She's not answering.

58:08.880 --> 58:10.040
Could have used the small box.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.050
Well, she looked bigger in the photo.

58:16.040 --> 58:17.040
God!

58:53.480 --> 58:55.160
God damn!

58:55.520 --> 58:56.520
Bitch!

58:59.400 --> 59:00.400
Fuck.

59:33.880 --> 59:35.120
We should go.

59:40.960 --> 59:43.850
Since when are accountants
difficult to ventilate?

59:45.320 --> 59:46.690
Dead?

59:46.840 --> 59:49.840
Christ! What'd he do, hit him
over the head with an adding machine?

59:54.120 --> 59:55.360
Oh, God.

59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.810
All right, just put me in touch
with the client.

1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:04.200
I'll handle this accountant myself.

1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:09.970
Running isn't an option for me.
I can't just walk out on my life!

1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:13.360
We have to go to the police.
That's what normal, taxpaying people do!

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:17.530
Police can't protect you from someone
who can afford to return $61 million.

1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:19.370
Return?
What are you talking about, "return"?

1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:21.280
The money was being put back.

1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:22.600
Stay here.

1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:25.240
What are you doing in here?

1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:26.560
- Who are you?
- You can't...

1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:27.850
You should not be here.

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.920
Sit down. Sit right there.

1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:35.210
What is this place?

1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:38.880
PanAmerica, Airstream.

1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:41.810
34 feet 7 inches long,

1:01:42.280 --> 1:01:44.200
8 feet 5 inches wide.

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:47.800
Dimensions which are perfectly adequate
for one person.

1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:49.410
Preferable, even.

1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:51.930
This is where you live?

1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:54.920
No, I don't live here.
This is a storage unit.

1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:56.080
That would be weird.

1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:57.650
That's what would be weird?

1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:00.200
I'd like to spend more time here.

1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:03.130
However, I'm afraid some of my clients
might follow me.

1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:06.410
Why would your clients follow you?
You're an accountant!

1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:10.160
How do you know what to do here?
Why are you prepared for this?

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:11.810
Plus, this is on wheels,

1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:14.200
which means I can hook it up
and be gone in 12 minutes.

1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:15.360
Usually.

1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:18.570
Sarcasm? Is that sarcasm?

1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:21.410
No, that's not sarcasm.
I don't use sarcasm. It's irritation.

1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:24.010
Everything in the world that is
important to me is in this trailer.

1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:26.450
And right now, changing my routine
for you is jeopardizing that.

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:33.680
Tell me that's not an original Pollock.

1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:39.920
We should go.

1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:43.290
Now.

1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:01.120
- Medina.
- Miss Medina?

1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:04.050
This is Gordon Amundson
with the FBI Language Services.

1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:06.010
Uh, yeah. Any luck?

1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:08.290
It's an unusual audio file.

1:03:08.440 --> 1:03:12.050
Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme
circa mid-1800s.

1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:14.570
Your voice has four of
the six intonation patterns

1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:16.560
we use to define American English.

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:19.010
That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.

1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:22.880
Out of curiosity,
was your subject a trauma victim?

1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:24.970
Um, why do you ask that?

1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:27.490
Well, you indicated on your submission

1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:30.370
that this event occurred
in a high-stress environment?

1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:32.410
Yeah. Exceptionally.

1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:33.970
That's interesting.

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:37.640
The verse was repeated
a total of four and a halftimes

1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:44.050
with zero variation in pitch, span, tempo,
volume, or articulatory precision.

1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:45.930
So, what does that mean, exactly?

1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:48.560
Well, we often see
this type of repetitive chanting

1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:50.920
in children
who have been exposed to trauma

1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:53.000
or persons with
neurodevelopmental disorders.

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:55.360
Neurodevelopmental disorders?

1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:57.770
Fragile-X syndrome, autism.

1:03:58.520 --> 1:03:59.850
Okay, so...

1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:01.760
Let's say I was looking at mugshots.

1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:05.450
How would that present itself?
What exactly would I be looking for?

1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:10.210
Fragile-X: Elongated face,
protruding ears, poor muscle tone.

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:13.410
Autism's nearly impossible
to identify visually.

1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:15.130
The traits are behavioral:

1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:18.090
difficulty with
social interaction, communication,

1:04:18.280 --> 1:04:20.090
lack of eye contact.

1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:23.130
Lack of eye contact.

1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:25.130
Okay.

1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:26.280
Good luck to you.

1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:27.440
Thanks.

1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:20.010
None of this makes sense.

1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:23.320
Why go through the trouble of skimming
the money if you're gonna put it back?

1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:24.680
Over the last two years,

1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:28.930
the number of invoices submitted
by Slewitt Manufacturing declined.

1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:30.650
Scared of getting caught?

1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:33.650
Price hikes?

1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:35.960
Prices of consumer electronics
go down, not up.

1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:38.320
Right, down, yeah.

1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:41.490
I can't afford this.

1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:43.290
I know. My treat.

1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:48.960
In the US, 104 men,

1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:53.360
last name any standard derivation
of your mathematician, Carl Gauss,

1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:58.970
reported over $500,000
in any of the last seven years.

1:05:59.120 --> 1:06:00.800
Okay. Go a million plus.

1:06:02.320 --> 1:06:03.530
Seventeen.

1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:07.210
Of the 17, how many between
the ages of 25 and 45?

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:09.040
Four.

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:10.530
Of those four,

1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:14.480
only one has an income stream
that's cash-heavy or easily laundered.

1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:15.800
And he

1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:18.890
died three years ago.

1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:26.800
What's this?

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.480
It's names of
the 100 most famous mathematicians.

1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:32.640
Look, we know what we're doing now.

1:06:32.840 --> 1:06:36.240
So, just enter the names,
narrow down the search right off the bat.

1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:37.850
Male, Caucasian,

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.610
25 to 45, earning a million plus.

1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:43.890
No investment income.
He'll concentrate on cash.

1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:46.370
What's in it for me?

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:49.890
Look, if you help me find him,

1:06:50.040 --> 1:06:51.850
I'll see what I can do
about getting you outta here.

1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:55.440
Please.

1:06:56.720 --> 1:06:58.530
Single earner or filing jointly?

1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:20.770
Hey, those paintings in your trailer...

1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:23.280
- They're real, right?
- Yes.

1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:25.890
You didn't buy them at auction, did you?

1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:27.770
They're a form of payment.

1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:29.800
Right.

1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:32.120
Hey.

1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:33.970
Thank you.

1:07:37.400 --> 1:07:38.610
At my apartment.

1:07:38.760 --> 1:07:39.760
Oh.

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:41.880
Yeah.

1:07:44.760 --> 1:07:46.440
Can we sit down for a second?

1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:50.290
Yeah. Okay.

1:07:58.640 --> 1:07:59.640
Just...

1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:04.290
Sit.

1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:21.690
How do you, um,

1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:25.970
know how to...

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:30.970
My father was an officer in the Army.
Psychological Operations.

1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:35.210
He was concerned that I might be
taken advantage of somehow,

1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:39.810
so he arranged for me to train
with a number of specialists

1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:41.330
throughout my childhood.

1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:44.410
We lived in 34 homes in 17 years.

1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:47.290
- You moved 34 times?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:50.560
God. That's extraordinary.

1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:55.560
No, I'm sure
it must've been difficult, but...

1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:57.930
I haven't been anywhere.

1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:03.040
Well, Cancun. Not my proudest moment.

1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:04.880
Um...

1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:08.090
I just mean...

1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:12.880
Your life is unique.

1:09:13.080 --> 1:09:17.090
It's not unique. I have
a high-functioning form of autism,

1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:19.960
which means I have
an extremely narrow focus

1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:23.090
and a hard time abandoning tasks
once I've taken them up.

1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:27.400
I have difficulty socializing
with other people, even though

1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:30.170
I want to.

1:09:36.600 --> 1:09:41.080
When I was a senior in high school,
I wanted this special dress for prom.

1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:44.770
I told myself that spending $100 on a
trashy dress that I was gonna wear one time

1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:46.970
to an event that I thought was
silly in the first place, was...

1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:49.370
- Wasteful.
- Yes.

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:54.010
But Vera Wang
made this black, strapless classic.

1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:56.770
It was more expensive, but you could
wear it to all kinds of future events.

1:09:56.960 --> 1:09:58.640
- It was an investment.
- Yes.

1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:00.730
Where were you when I was in high school?

1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:03.130
Oh, North Carolina, Israel.

1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:06.120
Right. Um...

1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:09.210
The problem was
they wanted $1700 for this dress,

1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:10.440
and I didn't have that, so...

1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:12.170
- You asked your parents?
- No.

1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:14.040
Hang on.

1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:18.490
Blackjack. I'd never played a hand,

1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:21.120
but I went to the library, and I
checked out all these books on strategy.

1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:23.800
And I turned the Naperville North
math club into a little Vegas.

1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:25.960
- What's a math club?
- Math club?

1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:28.850
You compete against other schools.

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000
Theory and speed math.

1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:36.280
Like, what's 298,567 times 92?

1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:41.640
27,468, 164.

1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:47.170
Right. Um...

1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:49.560
Blackjack.

1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:53.560
I could tell you
when to hit, stand, split, re-split.

1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:56.850
I moved on to card counting,
shuffle tracking, hole carding.

1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.720
And I took everything I had,
which was $183,

1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:03.690
and I drove down to Harrah's in Joliet.

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:05.370
Why was this dress so important to you?

1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:07.200
It wasn't about the dress.

1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:13.800
I just wanted to walk into the gym
and have everybody say "Wow!"

1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:19.040
I was trying to belong.

1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:21.320
I was trying to connect.

1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:27.050
I think no matter how different we are,
we're all trying to do the same thing.

1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:36.040
But I lost all but $20
in the first 10 minutes.

1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:39.730
I fed that into a nickel slot
on the way out,

1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:41.880
- and I won two grand.
- Hmm.

1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:44.410
I used the extra cash to pay for a limo.

1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:48.840
Only wore the dress the one time.

1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:03.240
Chris, why are we here?

1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:05.240
Um...

1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:09.200
I thought this hotel
had good water pressure.

1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:12.760
The Holiday Inn Express in Aurora
has good water pressure.

1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:15.610
Yes, but these towels are very fancy,

1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:19.650
and cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.

1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:22.490
And

1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:25.090
I wanted you to like it.

1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:44.770
Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.

1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:48.490
Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump.
Have you ever heard of...

1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:50.960
- What?
- Crazy Eddie Antar.

1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.170
He owned a string of electronic stores
in New York City in the '80s.

1:12:55.440 --> 1:12:58.840
Crazy Eddie Antar, he started stealing
almost as soon as he opened business.

1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.130
Okay, I'm not following.

1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:01.960
He deposited money in Tel Aviv,

1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:05.090
and then he cycled it through Panama
and put it back into his stores.

1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:06.690
Okay, why take it out and put it back?

1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:09.970
Well, initially he was just stealing
in garden-variety tax evasion,

1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:12.330
but then he came up with a better idea.

1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:14.400
You see, by taking his own money,

1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:16.960
stealing it, and putting it back
on his books...

1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:18.610
He was raining cash.

1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:20.680
He took the company public at $8 a share.

1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:23.530
A year later, it was trading at $75.

1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:28.530
- Rita's taking Living Robotics public.
- Yes.

1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:30.410
But why would she hire you
in the first place

1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:32.640
if she thought you would figure it out?

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:35.210
I don't know.

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:38.210
I'll have to ask her.

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.160
Whatever Rita's involvement,
it's not your concern.

1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:47.370
You disappear, I make a call.

1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:49.410
Please. I worry about you.

1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:52.010
If I don't do something, Dana will die.

1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:54.530
Risking your life for a girl
you've known a week.

1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:55.680
Why?

1:13:58.200 --> 1:13:59.570
Heavy sigh.

1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:01.210
What's the plan?

1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:03.490
Find the person who wants to kill her.

1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:04.850
And?

1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:06.810
Shoot them in the head.

1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:22.290
Last one.

1:16:22.440 --> 1:16:26.130
Wolff, two "F"s, Christian.

1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:29.850
Two hundred and forty five men.

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:33.680
Four with incomes over a million.

1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:38.570
All over the age of 60. Sorry.

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:41.850
Right. Your guy's an accountant.

1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:46.200
Two Christian Wolffs own CPA firms.

1:16:46.360 --> 1:16:49.200
The first Christian Wolff owns...

1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:55.160
Wolff Accounting. 121 South Street,
Scottsdale, Arizona.

1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:59.210
Income of 435 grand. It's a good year.

1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:03.040
So good, we audited him two years ago.

1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:04.360
He's clean.

1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:06.490
The other Christian Wolff...

1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:11.610
Nope. Only 75 grand.

1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:16.210
ZZZ Accounting.

1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:20.570
Wabash Way, Plainfield, Illinois.

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:21.880
ZZZ.

1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:25.570
I mean, it's not exactly
a smart Yellow Pages move.

1:17:29.760 --> 1:17:31.290
Wait a second.

1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:37.570
Who filed the returns for
Kim's Nails, Wabash Way, Plainfield?

1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:43.250
ZZZ Accounting.
Could just be the neighborly...

1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:45.770
Great Mandarin, Wabash.

1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:49.920
ZZZ Accounting.

1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:51.450
Paul's Laundromat.

1:17:55.240 --> 1:17:56.810
ZZZ Accounting.

1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:00.570
Tell me they're all
registered as partnerships.

1:18:02.840 --> 1:18:03.890
Every one.

1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:05.930
Managing partner...

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:07.240
Christian Wolff.

1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:18.570
- Christian Wolff.
- Come in.

1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:23.280
Christian Wolff, last year, ran $75,543
through his accounting firm.

1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:24.490
Whoa. Who is Christian Wolff?

1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:26.170
The accountant.

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:30.880
- 75 grand? That's chump change.
- Agreed.

1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:36.730
But he ran another $287,765
through Kim's Nails,

1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:41.520
$445, 112 through Great Mandarin Chinese,
and you'll love this,

1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:46.000
$505,909 through Paul's Laundromat.

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.650
Paul's Laundromat?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:50.850
He's playing with us.

1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:53.530
He can't clean that kind of money
through an accounting firm.

1:18:53.680 --> 1:18:55.210
The paper trail's too heavy.

1:18:55.360 --> 1:18:57.010
So, he's laundering it
through cash businesses.

1:18:57.160 --> 1:18:59.730
All of those are in the same strip mall
south of Chicago.

1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:01.160
ZZZ?

1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:04.480
I mean, he doesn't care about the traffic.
It's a front. All of it.

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:08.170
Christian Wolff, Carl Gauss,
Lou "Lewis" Carroll.

1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:11.480
He's using the names
of famous mathematicians as a cover.

1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:18.040
Charitable contributions here
to Harbor Neuroscience.

1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:20.330
Last year alone,
that's gotta come to close to...

1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:21.930
$1,000,100.

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:24.850
That one's not a cover.
That's the real deal. I checked.

1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:27.600
So, you're telling me
this guy risks his life

1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:31.560
doing forensic accounting for some
of the scariest people on the planet,

1:19:31.720 --> 1:19:34.170
collects his fee, goes through
all the trouble of laundering it,

1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:36.130
and then gives almost all of it away?

1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:40.690
Well, what if
he's taking other means of payment?

1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:44.720
Yeah, possible. Yeah.

1:19:46.560 --> 1:19:48.050
I caught him, Ray.

1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:50.040
Maybe.

1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:52.210
Pack a bag. We're going to Chicago.

1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:07.280
90% probability they're all right-handed.

1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:13.280
Up to me, I'd snap four right wrists.

1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:17.130
But maybe you enjoy waiting
on a schoolyard sucker punch.

1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:22.570
Life is a series of choices,
none of which are new.

1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:28.370
The oldest is choosing to be a victim.

1:21:28.520 --> 1:21:30.200
Or choosing not to.

1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:33.800
Second oldest: loyalty.

1:21:34.480 --> 1:21:37.640
Family first, good times or bad.

1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:45.840
Bonjour, fellas.

1:21:49.320 --> 1:21:51.210
They're only glasses.

1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:58.010
You think if you don't fight back,
then maybe they'll like you.

1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:01.770
Stop picking on you, calling you "freak."

1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:04.090
Well, here's what it is.

1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:07.240
They don't like you,
they don't dislike you.

1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:09.450
They're afraid of you.

1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:11.370
You're different.

1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:15.010
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.

1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:23.050
Victim or not? Make a decision.

1:22:57.360 --> 1:22:58.410
Go.

1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:14.770
You're different.

1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.840
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.

1:24:27.160 --> 1:24:28.530
In here.

1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:41.760
.357 Colt Python.

1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:44.170
Serial number's gone.

1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:46.880
Hydra-Shoks.

1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:00.930
Wireless security cam.

1:25:01.840 --> 1:25:04.240
Infrared, weatherproof.

1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:06.290
He's got a network of 'em.

1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:08.600
Whole backyard's got eyes.

1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:16.960
This is our guy.

1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:20.330
So, why does a guy who's
up to his elbows in cash live here?

1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:24.890
Given his clientele, he figures
blending in will extend his shelf life.

1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:27.170
It's the smart move.

1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:30.690
Well, maybe not smart enough.

1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:34.090
High-tech security cameras back here,

1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:37.560
anybody could roll up in the front.

1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:39.890
How does he cover this?

1:25:43.960 --> 1:25:46.250
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:55.610
Don't see that every day.

1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:00.490
Boys, let's have a situation report.

1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:02.560
We good, Ike?

1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:04.290
All clear.

1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:05.570
Rock and roll.

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:07.810
And how about you, sport?

1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:09.610
It's Bobby.

1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:12.090
I got nothing.

1:26:15.240 --> 1:26:17.930
Okay, yeah, I'm getting
a feed on the camera now.

1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:19.490
Move it to the left side.

1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:23.450
Is all this really necessary?

1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:25.530
You should be watching his home.

1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:26.810
Yeah? What you think?

1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:28.920
That's your idea on the subject?

1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:31.770
Love it when people tell me
how to do my job.

1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:33.760
I believe I recommended
you leave the country.

1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:36.610
- You declined.
- He's an accountant!

1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:40.690
I could see it in his eyes.
The freak wasn't gonna let it go.

1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:45.810
My best to Michelle.

1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:47.170
I will.

1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:06.650
I was old 10 years ago.

1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:11.800
So, what's your story, Medina?

1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:14.490
You know my story.

1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:17.010
I know what the courts said.

1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:23.520
Stuffed a handful of cocaine
up a drug dealer's nose,

1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:26.160
pistol-whipped him
into the trunk of his car.

1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:30.720
I was 17. It was August.

1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:34.930
He cooked for three days, but lived.

1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:36.530
Do you regret it?

1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:39.160
The coke was half borax.

1:27:39.680 --> 1:27:42.050
Same shit he kept selling my sister.

1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:46.000
She's a dental hygienist in Annapolis now.

1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:48.210
Married, three kids.

1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:53.450
No, I don't regret it.

1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:56.370
That's rough.

1:27:57.520 --> 1:27:59.570
All due respect, Director King,

1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:02.200
what the fuck do you know about "rough"?

1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:08.930
Wait! I gotta call it in!

1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:10.080
Move it!

1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:11.890
You tell me, Medina.

1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:20.290
Men kill each other
for any number of reasons.

1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:21.560
Bobby, you hear me?

1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:24.410
Money, power...

1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:25.810
Fear.

1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:27.330
Right there, motherfucker!

1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:33.850
Nine men would die
that day at the Ravenite,

1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:36.200
but for none of those reasons.

1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:42.920
No, they'd taken something
from the man who was killing them.

1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:47.090
Something that couldn't
be made whole again.

1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:50.920
Something very important to him.

1:28:52.600 --> 1:28:54.810
And he was there for his pound of flesh.

1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:56.490
Please.

1:28:56.680 --> 1:28:58.090
Just fucking stop, man!

1:28:58.240 --> 1:28:59.890
Just put the gun down!

1:29:01.480 --> 1:29:03.160
Little Tony Bazzano.

1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:06.680
I'd been wedged in a van for six months

1:29:06.840 --> 1:29:09.810
listening to that arrogant little prick
belch, fart, and brag.

1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:11.360
Please.

1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:12.970
I'm fucking begging you.

1:29:13.160 --> 1:29:15.930
I didn't recognize his voice
with all the fear in it.

1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:18.930
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:20.280
I wasn't even...

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:26.960
Our man had come for revenge.

1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:29.810
And he got it.

1:29:30.840 --> 1:29:32.170
Nine dead.

1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:36.490
And I was 10.

1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:41.090
Your name?

1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:43.890
Ray.

1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:46.720
Raymond King.

1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:49.120
Who employs you, Raymond King?

1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:52.650
I'm a Treasury agent.

1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:56.010
Are you a good one?

1:29:58.480 --> 1:29:59.610
No.

1:29:59.760 --> 1:30:01.330
No, not particularly.

1:30:03.480 --> 1:30:04.720
Is that it?

1:30:07.080 --> 1:30:08.840
Kids, I got... I'm a dad.

1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:10.530
I got two kids.

1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:13.370
Grown?

1:30:15.840 --> 1:30:17.000
Yeah.

1:30:17.680 --> 1:30:20.600
Yes, yes, they're all...
They're all grown up.

1:30:22.400 --> 1:30:24.930
Were you a good dad, Raymond King?

1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:31.170
Yeah. I've been a good dad.

1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:37.850
I'm a lousy agent,
and I've been a weak man,

1:30:39.400 --> 1:30:41.530
but that I didn't screw up.

1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:44.680
That I got right.

1:30:58.760 --> 1:31:00.090
Imagine you're a Treasury agent

1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:04.450
approaching the twilight
of a spectacularly dismal career.

1:31:06.080 --> 1:31:10.610
And then one day, that break
you should have been looking for.

1:31:10.760 --> 1:31:13.890
Francis Silverberg, a black money legend.

1:31:14.040 --> 1:31:17.570
Cleaned cash from Monte Carlo
to Havana to Vegas.

1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:22.810
He cooked the books for the Gambino family
for 40-plus years.

1:31:22.960 --> 1:31:25.410
Until one day, the boss, Big Tony Bazzano,

1:31:25.560 --> 1:31:29.090
thought maybe the old man's age
made him vulnerable to prosecution.

1:31:29.240 --> 1:31:32.290
Ordered his son, Little Tony,
to kill Francis.

1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:34.290
Kid fucked it up.

1:31:34.440 --> 1:31:38.680
Francis ran, became a federal informant
in return for protective custody.

1:31:39.480 --> 1:31:41.960
Could have turned my career around

1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:43.770
if only I'd listened.

1:31:45.680 --> 1:31:46.920
I didn't.

1:31:47.480 --> 1:31:51.170
He was processed out,
and he lost the only protection he had.

1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:52.690
Stand clear of the gate.

1:31:52.840 --> 1:31:57.770
The protection that he was promised
when he testified against Big Tony.

1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:03.650
And this time, Little Tony got it right.

1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:06.610
He had Francis in a couple hours.

1:32:08.120 --> 1:32:12.010
Down in a filthy basement in the Bronx,
nailed to a chair,

1:32:13.640 --> 1:32:15.450
tortured to death.

1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:23.130
So, I volunteered for a joint task force.

1:32:23.640 --> 1:32:26.560
Sat outside the Ravenite
in a surveillance van for months

1:32:26.720 --> 1:32:29.850
hoping to get a shred of evidence
to use against Francis' killers.

1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:34.640
Wait! Wait!

1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:36.130
I gotta call it in!

1:32:37.920 --> 1:32:38.970
Move it!

1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:41.640
I went in there hoping
I could ease my guilt.

1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:45.640
And I met our accountant.

1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:50.050
Why he let me live, I didn't know.

1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:53.290
But he changed my life.

1:32:56.640 --> 1:32:58.690
Gave my notice at the Department.

1:32:59.760 --> 1:33:02.330
I started looking forward
to the day again.

1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:05.210
You know, feeling the sun on my face.

1:33:05.840 --> 1:33:07.330
Quit drinking.

1:33:07.880 --> 1:33:09.690
Was on my way out the door...

1:33:11.320 --> 1:33:12.850
And then, the phone rang.

1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:14.520
Ray King.

1:33:14.680 --> 1:33:16.170
I'll never forget that voice.

1:33:16.360 --> 1:33:18.570
Do you like puzzles, Raymond King?

1:33:20.840 --> 1:33:23.210
She tells me she works for the accountant.

1:33:24.080 --> 1:33:27.450
And that a shipping container
packed with Chinese nationals

1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:30.290
is passing through the Port of New York.

1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:32.450
Few months later,

1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:36.760
one ton of uncut Ju\E1rez cartel product
is entering Miami.

1:33:38.880 --> 1:33:41.530
All those cases you put together...

1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:44.370
Smoke and mirrors.

1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:49.730
So, who is he?

1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:52.240
This accountant.

1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:56.120
Prisoner 831.
Fort Leavenworth, maximum security.

1:33:56.320 --> 1:33:57.560
Military prison?

1:33:58.560 --> 1:33:59.890
So, he was in the Army?

1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:04.480
Army lent him to us to track
al-Qaeda money launderers.

1:34:05.720 --> 1:34:09.250
He was transferred from Leavenworth
to our detention center in D.C.

1:34:10.800 --> 1:34:12.720
Did the work of five men.

1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:16.120
Data mining, cluster analysis.

1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:19.290
He roomed with Francis.

1:34:19.720 --> 1:34:22.450
They kept to themselves, played chess,

1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:26.080
ate together, sat in the TV room together.

1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:28.970
They were inseparable.

1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:32.290
And then one day, a guard told Wolff

1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:35.810
why Francis hadn't called or written
since he got out.

1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:40.250
That his burnt body had been found
in a Staten Island landfill.

1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:45.410
Wolff snapped, went after the guard.

1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:48.760
He fractured the man's skull
with a thermos.

1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:51.520
Escaped from a third-floor window.

1:34:52.840 --> 1:34:54.290
Took the thermos.

1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:58.210
That's all you got? I mean, Leavenworth,
he'll have military records...

1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:00.040
Records are all heavily redacted.

1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:01.960
Well, then arrest records, something?

1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:06.490
Spring of 2003, at a funeral home
in Kankakee, Illinois.

1:35:07.960 --> 1:35:12.200
Our boy sends six locals to the hospital
with a variety of injuries.

1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:15.330
No one knew Wolff.

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.290
The older man who came with him
was identified as a colonel, US Army.

1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:23.810
A funeral home.

1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:25.810
Whose wake?

1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:28.200
One customer that day.

1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:33.530
Mrs. Lauren Alton.

1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:39.810
Mrs. Alton taught first grade
for 13 years in Kankakee.

1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:43.490
Survived by a husband
and two boys, ages 12 and 10.

1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:48.040
By all accounts,
an ordinary life, well lived.

1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:50.330
But cut short.

1:35:51.400 --> 1:35:52.690
It'll be all right.

1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:57.680
Excuse me, sir, this is family only.

1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:01.850
Sir, I'm going to ask you to step outside.

1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:06.760
And then a fight breaks out.
A brawl, really.

1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:10.080
Over what,
the authorities never pinned down.

1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:11.360
Get your hands...

1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:17.210
Deputies respond.

1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:22.770
A Barney Fife-type squares off
with our boy, gets rattled, pulls his gun.

1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:26.890
The colonel just stepped in front of 831.

1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:30.410
Army collects both men.

1:36:31.400 --> 1:36:34.210
Police report names Wolff
as "Soldier One."

1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:37.610
And widower
identified the colonel by name.

1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:40.360
His late wife's former husband.

1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:42.800
I checked. It's an alias.

1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:45.920
No more real than "Christian Wolff."

1:36:49.560 --> 1:36:52.290
She was the dead colonel's ex-wife.

1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:57.410
And you think Wolff is what to him?

1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:07.320
Were you a good dad, Ray King?

1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:19.760
I've given up trying to figure out
when I'll get a call.

1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:22.760
The "why" though, that I've got.

1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:25.960
Someone breaks his moral code.

1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:39.130
Why are you telling me this?

1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:41.360
I'm retiring in a few months.

1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:44.840
When she calls,

1:37:46.680 --> 1:37:49.160
somebody needs to be there to answer.

1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:05.120
No.

1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:10.200
He's a criminal, Ray.

1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:11.480
Yeah.

1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:14.800
He aids and abets drug cartels,
money launderers.

1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:17.880
He's a fucking killer.

1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:21.410
Believe me,
I wrestled with the same decision.

1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:26.000
But when I got that first call,

1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:28.640
I realized something.

1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:37.530
I'd spent my whole life only recognizing
my lucky breaks after they were gone.

1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:46.250
The Brit, who is she?

1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:01.280
Hello?

1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:02.850
Miss Medina.

1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:07.010
Tell Eliot Ness to get his feet
off the furniture.

1:39:07.160 --> 1:39:09.050
He's not in a barn.

1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:12.210
Living Robotics.

1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:14.450
Write it down.

1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:21.320
North of six feet, short hair,
athletic build, yes?

1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:23.450
- Correct.
- But when you say short hair,

1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:25.720
you mean short hair like my hair,
or you mean short hair like...

1:39:25.880 --> 1:39:27.040
What's the difference?

1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:28.880
I was told you could fix this, so fix it!

1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:31.040
But you did speak to the man, am I right?
You spoke to him?

1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:32.600
What did he sound like?

1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:36.050
I didn't make small talk.
What's it matter what he sounded...

1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:39.880
That's Ike, right? That's the north side?

1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:42.560
Yo, Bobby, was that you?

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:45.560
Bob.

1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:51.640
Bobby.

1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:54.400
Ike, are you there?

1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:57.160
Ike?

1:39:58.760 --> 1:40:01.240
Guys, stop fucking around.
Someone answer me. Ike?

1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:03.080
Pull was to the left.

1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:06.770
You might consider using a round
with a superior ballistic coefficient.

1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:11.440
Give me the layout of the home.

1:40:11.600 --> 1:40:14.840
Points of entry, corridors, rooms, cover.

1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:16.000
Go.

1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:19.250
Fuck.

1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:22.720
- Sit down.
- What's this...

1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:24.720
Shut up. Sit down in the chair.

1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:56.650
You ever see a match-grade round traveling
3,000 feet per second go through a window?

1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:00.080
Nobody does.

1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:01.400
Get down, now!

1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:40.680
Four men, front entrance.

1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:43.130
Go right at him. Go now.

1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:49.720
You...

1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:51.800
I got the cameras.

1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:53.600
Go join your friends.

1:41:58.520 --> 1:41:59.520
Up.

1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:03.480
Clear.

1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:17.760
Smoke.

1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:43.970
Go, go!

1:42:45.080 --> 1:42:46.210
Go, go!

1:43:02.160 --> 1:43:03.760
Attack front entry!

1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:05.410
Man down!

1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:08.970
Guys, talk to me.

1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:15.360
You got eyes on who it is?

1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:18.200
Someone talk to me.
Let me know what the sitrep is.

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:40.040
Are they dead?

1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:47.330
Give me a situation report. How many down?

1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:49.730
Are they dead? Answer me!

1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:54.930
Okay, he's on the roof.
Start forming up. Let's move.

1:43:55.120 --> 1:43:56.770
Check skylights, check windows.

1:43:56.920 --> 1:43:58.000
That motherfucker comes in,

1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:00.640
I wanna hear gunshots
and I wanna hear "target eliminated."

1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:13.410
That's enough. He's in the goddamn house.

1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:15.450
Get out there and end this!

1:44:15.680 --> 1:44:18.210
Brax, give me a situation report.
Have you got eyes on anything?

1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:29.040
What's happening?

1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:31.130
Say something!

1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:51.010
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:55.280
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

1:46:56.160 --> 1:47:00.320
Sick on Thursday
Worse on Friday

1:47:01.480 --> 1:47:05.410
Died on Saturday
Buried on Sunday

1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:10.490
"And that was the end of Solomon Grundy"

1:47:14.160 --> 1:47:15.760
What is this?

1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:38.200
Hey! Hey!

1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:39.440
Stand down!

1:47:39.640 --> 1:47:40.690
Fuck off!

1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:23.090
Hello, Braxton.

1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:25.080
No, no.

1:48:27.920 --> 1:48:29.050
Don't...

1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:31.450
Don't do that...

1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:36.210
Been looking for you for 10 years,

1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:38.480
and you're gonna come at me
like we just saw each other yesterday?

1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:40.290
That's what you're gonna do?

1:48:40.520 --> 1:48:41.680
What did I...

1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:44.130
What'd I think?

1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:47.760
What'd I think? That you were gonna be
happy to see me, I guess.

1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:50.970
I am happy.

1:48:56.440 --> 1:48:58.040
I need to finish.

1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:01.280
You should go.

1:49:01.440 --> 1:49:02.890
I should go?

1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:05.450
Okay...

1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:07.930
Okay, I'll just go.

1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:11.090
But first, I'm gonna ask you a question.

1:49:11.240 --> 1:49:12.650
You're gonna give me an answer.

1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:15.770
Why would you and Pop go to that funeral?

1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:17.450
She left us. Do you not remember that?

1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:19.170
Do you not remember that?

1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:29.450
It's your fault that Pop's dead!
You hear me?

1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:30.600
It's your fault!

1:49:30.760 --> 1:49:32.570
- I'm sorry, Braxton.
- Sorry?

1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:34.640
Sorry doesn't cut it, you weird fuck!

1:49:57.120 --> 1:49:59.960
You don't give a shit about me?
You don't give a shit about me?

1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:08.650
How about now?

1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:10.930
How about now?

1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:19.130
Are you gonna fight?

1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:22.520
Fight!

1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:16.610
I'm sorry, Braxton.

1:51:20.360 --> 1:51:22.440
If you had to see her,

1:51:24.280 --> 1:51:27.010
if that was something that you had to do,

1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:29.290
you call me.

1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.890
I'm your brother.
I've always had your back.

1:51:33.880 --> 1:51:36.250
You don't call him, you call me.

1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:44.800
Did you even wonder where I was?

1:51:44.960 --> 1:51:46.610
I knew where you were.

1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:49.730
I just wanted you to be safe.

1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:53.650
Some of my clients are quite dangerous.

1:51:56.080 --> 1:52:00.050
I'm, kind of, considered
fairly dangerous myself.

1:52:02.120 --> 1:52:03.720
Well, you've made improvements.

1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:13.930
Shit, man.

1:52:15.080 --> 1:52:16.810
You and me here...

1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:19.130
What are the odds?

1:52:19.280 --> 1:52:20.490
Statistically speaking...

1:52:20.640 --> 1:52:22.640
Christ, man! It's rhetorical.

1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:24.650
I mean, really?

1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:27.210
I was just saying.

1:52:31.320 --> 1:52:33.450
Not happy.

1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:37.290
Do you consider
what you do important, Mr. Wolff?

1:52:37.440 --> 1:52:39.760
To someone other than yourself, I mean?

1:52:40.160 --> 1:52:42.240
What I do is.

1:52:42.800 --> 1:52:46.850
Living Robotics' public offering
would've been worth billions.

1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:49.970
Money to be used
for neuroprosthetics, nanotechnology.

1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:51.170
You...

1:52:53.200 --> 1:52:55.490
Why in God's name did I ever hire you?

1:52:55.640 --> 1:52:57.480
To leak-proof your books.

1:52:57.920 --> 1:53:01.850
Dana found a mistake, and you wanted
to be sure it was safe to go public.

1:53:02.520 --> 1:53:04.120
And now you want to kill her.

1:53:04.280 --> 1:53:05.440
I'm fond of Dana.

1:53:05.960 --> 1:53:08.530
But I restore lives, not Dana! Me!

1:53:08.680 --> 1:53:12.730
Men, women, children,
I give them hope. Make them whole.

1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:14.450
Do you even know what that's like?

1:53:14.640 --> 1:53:15.880
Yes, I do.

1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:31.520
Sorry.

1:53:35.400 --> 1:53:36.890
I missed you.

1:53:44.040 --> 1:53:45.800
"Missed you, too, Braxton.

1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:50.240
"Missed you, too, because I love you.

1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:53.080
"You're my brother."

1:53:55.680 --> 1:53:56.920
Maybe...

1:53:57.680 --> 1:53:59.280
Do you want to...

1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:02.240
Maybe I could see you in a week?

1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:04.610
You name the place. I'll be there.

1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:20.360
How will I find you?

1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:22.970
You won't.

1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:25.200
I'll find you.

1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:32.320
There.

1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:35.450
How do you respond to rumors

1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:38.970
that some of the victims have wounds
consistent with anti-aircraft rounds?

1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:40.960
I'd say the Chicago Police Department

1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:44.120
has ample experience
solving all manner of homicides.

1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:47.650
Tom.

1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:49.810
Sir, how are the conspiracy
and fraud charges

1:54:49.960 --> 1:54:52.690
related to the deaths of Lamar Blackburn
and his sister, Rita?

1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:55.000
This is a very fluid situation

1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:59.130
with a lot of surprising revelations
over the last 48 hours.

1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:02.930
Let me introduce you to the person
leading the investigation...

1:55:04.040 --> 1:55:05.170
Agent Medina.

1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:16.690
Um...

1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:18.200
Good afternoon.

1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:24.930
As much as I'd like
to take credit for this,

1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:27.760
I can't.

1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:37.730
Because this was a team effort

1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:42.570
comprised of long hours
of good old-fashioned investigative work.

1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:43.720
Questions?

1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:53.560
He was just like our other two.
He was a happy baby.

1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:56.560
Now he rarely speaks.

1:55:57.200 --> 1:55:59.650
It's like our child is missing.
He's not there.

1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:02.200
He's lost, and he needs our help.

1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:04.890
We thought...

1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:07.890
We thought...

1:56:08.040 --> 1:56:10.730
We hoped that he would catch back up.

1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:12.880
But he didn't.

1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:15.120
One in 68 children in this country

1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:18.290
are diagnosed with a form of autism.

1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:19.970
But if you can put aside for a moment

1:56:20.160 --> 1:56:23.770
what your pediatrician and all
the other NTs have said about your son...

1:56:23.920 --> 1:56:25.250
What? NTs?

1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:27.610
Neurotypicals.

1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:29.450
The rest of us.

1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:32.320
What if we're wrong?

1:56:32.920 --> 1:56:35.000
What if we've been using the wrong tests

1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:38.480
to quantify intelligence
in children with autism?

1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:41.650
Your son's not less-than.

1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:44.610
He's different.

1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:49.330
Now, your expectations for your son
may change over time.

1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:53.920
They might include
marriage, children, self-sufficiency.

1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:55.650
And they might not.

1:56:56.760 --> 1:56:57.810
But I guarantee you,

1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:01.810
if we let the world set expectations
for our children, they'll start low...

1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:05.010
And they'll stay there.

1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:10.360
Maybe your son's capable of
much more than we know.

1:57:12.200 --> 1:57:13.770
And maybe,

1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.130
just maybe,

1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:17.960
he doesn't understand how to tell us.

1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:21.290
Or...

1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:24.890
We haven't yet learned how to listen.

1:57:51.360 --> 1:57:53.730
Honey, for the hundredth time,
don't wander off like that.

1:57:54.160 --> 1:57:56.530
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. It's fine.

1:57:56.680 --> 1:57:58.650
Can he visit with you
for a while, Justine?

1:58:00.840 --> 1:58:03.160
Okay, good. Come on, folks.
I'll give you the nickel tour.

1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:04.370
You okay with that?

1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:06.520
It's okay, hon. Come on.

1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:08.400
No, they'll be fine.

1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:13.360
Justine's one of
our few full-time residents.

1:58:13.560 --> 1:58:15.850
She stopped talking 30 years ago.

1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:18.530
Communicates with
a digital translator now.

1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:21.170
Doctor, how is Harbor funded?

1:58:21.360 --> 1:58:24.730
We're fortunate to have
very generous private donors.

1:58:24.880 --> 1:58:26.210
I'll say they're generous.

1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:27.600
Oh, why is that?

1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:29.520
That woman, Justine...

1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:31.920
- Yeah, my daughter.
- She's your daughter?

1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:34.360
The reason I started the institute.

1:58:34.840 --> 1:58:37.290
Justine's computer, it's a BX32.

1:58:37.560 --> 1:58:39.530
Water-cooled, 12 core.

1:58:39.960 --> 1:58:42.530
Oh, that's right.
You're a software engineer.

1:58:42.680 --> 1:58:46.450
Well, some of our donors
are more generous than others.

1:58:46.640 --> 1:58:48.610
Why? Is that a good computer?

1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:50.410
Good?

1:58:50.880 --> 1:58:53.650
Doc, she could backdoor
the Pentagon with that rig.

1:58:56.800 --> 1:58:59.410
Hello, dreamboat. Shall we chat?

1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:27.320
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:59:27.480 --> 1:59:28.770
Sign here, please.

1:59:32.080 --> 1:59:33.290
Thank you.

1:59:35.320 --> 1:59:36.560
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
